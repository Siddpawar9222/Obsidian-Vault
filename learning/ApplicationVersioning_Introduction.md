Version numbers, like `0.0.1`, are used to keep track of updates or changes in a project or software. They usually follow a format called **"semantic versioning"** (or **"semver"** for short), which looks like this:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

Here’s a breakdown of what each part typically means:

### Example: `0.0.1`

- **PATCH (last number)**: Small fixes or improvements, usually things that don’t change how the software works but fix small bugs. `0.0.1` would mean it's the first small patch.

- **MINOR (middle number)**: New features or improvements that are added but are still compatible with existing features. For example, if `0.0.1` changes to `0.1.0`, that usually means new features were added without breaking old ones.

- **MAJOR (first number)**: Big changes that might break compatibility with older versions. When this number changes, like going from `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`, it usually means there are significant changes, and you might need to make adjustments when you update.

### Examples
1. **`0.0.1`**: First small patch version, usually in early development.
2. **`1.0.0`**: First stable version, ready for production use.
3. **`1.2.3`**: This means it’s the first major release (`1`), with two minor updates (`2`), and three small patches (`3`).

So, in short:

- `0.0.1`: Early version with a small fix or update.
- `1.0.0`: First stable release, major version.
- `1.2.0`: Added some new features without breaking anything.
- `2.0.0`: Major changes that might not be compatible with version `1.x.x`.

This helps developers and users understand how much has changed and whether they need to be careful when updating.
