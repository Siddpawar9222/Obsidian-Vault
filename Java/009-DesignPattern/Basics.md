### Definition

**Design Patterns are proven, reusable solutions to common problems in software design.**

---

###  What this really means

- **Common problems**  
    → Problems that developers face **again and again**  
    (object creation, communication, structure, flexibility, etc.)
    
- **Design patterns**  
    → **Not code**, but **ideas / templates**  
    → They tell you _how to design_, not _what exact code to write_
    
- **Proven**  
    → Used by millions of developers  
    → Time-tested in real projects

###  Simple real-world example

Problem:

> “I need only ONE database connection in my app.”

Solution:

> **Singleton pattern**

Problem:

> “I don’t want my code to depend on concrete classes.”

Solution:

> **Factory pattern**

These problems are common → design patterns solve them.

### ❌ One important correction

Design patterns are **NOT**:

- Libraries
    
- Frameworks
    
- Ready-made code
    

They are **ways of thinking and structuring code**.

| Pattern Type   | What They Do                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Creational** | Manage **how objects are created**                 |
| **Structural** | Manage **how objects are arranged & connected**    |
| **Behavioral** | Manage **how objects behave & talk to each other** |
