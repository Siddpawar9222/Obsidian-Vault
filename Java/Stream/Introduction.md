### **What is a Stream in Java?**
Stream  is a <font color="#ffff00">**sequence of elements**</font> that can be processed in a functional and declarative way. <font color="#ffff00">Think of it as a pipeline</font> through which data flows, and you can perform operations on that data as it passes through the pipeline.

- Streams are designed to work with collections (like lists, sets, or arrays) but are not collections themselves.
- They allow you to perform complex data processing tasks (like filtering, mapping, sorting, etc.) in a concise and readable way.

### **Key Features of Java Streams**

#### 1. **Not a Data Structure**
- A stream does not store data. Instead, it takes input from a source (like a collection, array, or I/O channel) and processes it.
- Example: If you have a list of numbers, the stream doesn’t store the numbers but processes them on the fly.

#### 2. **Functional in Nature**
- Streams support **functional programming** operations like `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, etc.
- You can chain multiple operations together to create a pipeline.
- Example: Filter even numbers, then square them, and finally sum them up.

#### 3. **Lazy Evaluation**
- Intermediate operations (like `filter`, `map`) are not executed until a terminal operation (like `collect`, `forEach`) is called.
- This makes streams efficient because they only process the data when needed.
- Example: If you filter a list of 1000 items but only need the first 5, the stream will stop processing after finding those 5 items.

#### 4. **Parallel Processing**
- Streams can easily be processed in parallel using the `parallelStream()` method.
- This is useful for large datasets where performance is critical.
- Example: Processing a list of 1 million records in parallel to speed up the computation.

#### 5. **Cannot Reuse Streams**
- Once a stream is consumed (i.e., a terminal operation is performed), it cannot be reused.
- Example: If you use a stream to filter data and collect the results, you cannot use the same stream again. You need to create a new stream.

#### 6. **Supports Pipelining**
- You can chain multiple operations together to form a pipeline.
- Example: `list.stream().filter().map().collect()`.
- Each operation in the pipeline processes the data and passes it to the next operation.

#### 7. **Internal Iteration**
- Streams handle iteration internally. You don’t need to write loops (like `for` or `while`) to process data.
- Example: Instead of writing a loop to filter a list, you can simply use `filter()`.

### **What is the Declarative Way?**

In programming, there are two main styles of writing code:
1. **Imperative**: You tell the computer **how** to do something step by step.
2. **Declarative**: You tell the computer **what** you want to achieve, and it figures out how to do it.

Java Streams follow the **declarative style**. This means you focus on **what** you want to accomplish (e.g., filter data, transform data, etc.) rather than **how** to do it (e.g., writing loops, managing counters, etc.).

### **Declarative Way in Streams**

When using streams, you describe the operations you want to perform on the data (like filtering, mapping, sorting, etc.) without worrying about the underlying implementation details. The stream API takes care of the "how" for you.

#### Example:
Let’s say you have a list of numbers, and you want to:
1. Filter out the even numbers.
2. Square each of the remaining numbers.
3. Sum them up.

In a **declarative way**, you would simply say:
- "Give me the sum of squares of even numbers."

You don’t need to write loops or manage variables. Instead, you use stream operations like `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` to achieve this.

### **Why is Declarative Style Useful?**
1. **Readability**: The code becomes easier to read and understand because it focuses on the "what" rather than the "how."
2. **Conciseness**: You can achieve complex operations in just a few lines of code.
3. **Less Error-Prone**: Since you’re not writing low-level logic (like loops), there’s less chance of making mistakes.
4. **Functional Programming**: It aligns with functional programming principles, making your code more modular and reusable.
