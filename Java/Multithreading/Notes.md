## 🔹 What is a **2-core processor**?

- Your Ryzen 3 3250U is a **2-core CPU** (actually 2 cores, 4 threads with SMT).
    
- **Core = brain** of the processor → it executes instructions.
    
- So 2 cores = 2 brains → CPU can handle **two tasks at the same time**.

## 🔹 Parallelism vs Concurrency

👉 These two words are related but **not the same**.

### ✅ Concurrency

- **Multiple tasks make progress by sharing time** on the same core.
    
- Tasks may not run _exactly_ at the same moment, but the CPU switches between them very fast.
    
- Looks like they’re running “together”.
    

**Analogy**:  
1 cook, 2 dishes → the cook cuts vegetables for dish 1, then stirs dish 2, then goes back to dish 1… both dishes progress, but not exactly at the same instant.

### ✅ Parallelism

- **Multiple tasks run at the same exact time** on different cores.
    
- Needs multiple cores (or multiple machines).
    

**Analogy**:  
2 cooks, 2 dishes → both dishes are cooked **at the same time**.

## 🔹 Now in your **2-core CPU**

- Each core can execute one task in parallel.
    
- With **2 cores**, you can truly run **two tasks at the same time** → parallelism.
    
- But when you run **many more tasks** (e.g., 20 apps), the OS uses **concurrency** → time-slicing and scheduling tasks across the 2 cores.
    

---

## 🔹 Example in your laptop

- Running **Docker container** on core 1.
    
- Running **IntelliJ IDEA** on core 2.  
    👉 This is **parallelism**.
    
- But inside IntelliJ, you’re typing, indexing, plugins running… they all share the same core by time-slicing.  
    👉 That’s **concurrency**.
    

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

- Your **2-core CPU** gives you **true parallelism for 2 tasks**.
    
- But when you run **many apps**, the OS uses **concurrency** (task scheduling) to make it _look_ like everything runs at once.

👉 Do you want me to also explain what **threads (4 threads in your CPU)** mean and how they fit into concurrency vs parallelism?
