## ðŸ”¹ Why ExecutorService came?

In old Java (before Java 5):

- If you wanted multiple tasks in parallel, you had to **manually create and manage threads**:
    

```java
Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> doWork());
t1.start();
```

Problems:

1. **Thread creation is expensive**
    
    - Every `new Thread()` creates a fresh OS thread, costly in terms of memory & CPU.
        
    - If you create thousands of threads â†’ performance crashes.
        
2. **No thread reuse**
    
    - After a thread finishes, it dies. You cannot reuse it.
        
    - Waste of resources.
        
3. **Difficult to manage**
    
    - If you want to run 100 tasks, how many threads should you create?
        
    - How to queue tasks if all threads are busy?
        
    - No built-in way to gracefully shut down threads.
        

ðŸ‘‰ This is why **Java 5 introduced Executor Framework** (java.util.concurrent).

## ðŸ”¹ What is ExecutorService?

- An **abstraction** over manual thread management.
    
- You **submit tasks** (`Runnable` or `Callable`) instead of creating threads yourself.
    
- ExecutorService decides:
    
    - How many threads to use
        
    - When to create them
        
    - When to reuse them
        
    - How to queue tasks

## ðŸ”¹ Example without ExecutorService

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    new Thread(() -> {
        System.out.println("Task by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }).start();
}
```

- Creates 10 threads.
    
- Each thread is new â†’ no reuse.

## ðŸ”¹ Example with ExecutorService

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ExecutorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

**Output (sample):**

```
Task 0 executed by pool-1-thread-1
Task 1 executed by pool-1-thread-2
Task 2 executed by pool-1-thread-3
Task 3 executed by pool-1-thread-1
...
```

ðŸ‘‰ Here only **3 threads** are created and **reused** to run 10 tasks. Much more efficient.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Thread Pools

The `Executors` factory provides several built-in thread pools:

1. **FixedThreadPool**
    
    - A pool with a fixed number of threads.
        
    - If all threads are busy, new tasks wait in a queue.
        
    - âœ… Good for: predictable workloads.
        
    
    ```java
    Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
    ```
    

---

2. **CachedThreadPool**
    
    - Creates new threads as needed, but reuses old ones if available.
        
    - If no limit â†’ can grow very large (dangerous if too many tasks).
        
    - âœ… Good for: many short-lived async tasks.
        
    
    ```java
    Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
    ```
    

---

3. **SingleThreadExecutor**
    
    - Only one thread, executes tasks sequentially.
        
    - âœ… Good for: tasks that must not run in parallel (like writing to a file).
        
    
    ```java
    Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    ```
    

---

4. **ScheduledThreadPool**
    
    - Runs tasks after a delay or periodically (like cron jobs).
        
    - âœ… Good for: scheduling jobs, heartbeat, monitoring tasks.
        
    
    ```java
    Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);
    ```
    

---

5. **WorkStealingPool** (Java 8+)
    
    - Uses **ForkJoinPool** internally.
        
    - Threads "steal" tasks from each otherâ€™s queues to maximize CPU usage.
        
    - âœ… Good for: CPU-intensive parallel processing.
        
    
    ```java
    Executors.newWorkStealingPool();
    ```
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why is this important for backend developers?

- In web apps, backend servers like **Tomcat, Undertow, Jetty** use thread pools under the hood.
    
- In Spring Boot, `@Async` uses ExecutorService internally.
    
- Thread pools make the system **scalable, resource-efficient, and stable**.
    

---

âœ… So in short:

- **Threads** â†’ too manual, inefficient.
    
- **ExecutorService** â†’ abstraction that gives you **thread pools**, task queuing, better management.
    
- Different **thread pools** suit different workloads.

- `Executors` : Factory and utility methods for `Executor`, `ExecutorService`, `ScheduledExecutorService`, `ThreadFactory`, and `Callable` classes defined in this package.
