## 🧵 Multithreading vs Concurrency

### **Multithreading**

- Means: **a program can run multiple threads at the same time**.
    
- It’s just the ability to split tasks into threads.
    
- But if those threads need to share data → problems can happen.
    

👉 Example:  
Two threads withdraw money from the **same bank account object**.  
Both read balance = 1000 at the same time → both withdraw 800 → final balance becomes 200 (should be -600).  
This is a **data inconsistency**.

So, **multithreading is just creating multiple threads**, but **does not guarantee correctness when threads interact**.

### **Concurrency**

- Means: **managing multiple threads safely when they access shared resources**.
    
- It’s not just about running threads, but about **coordinating** them.
    
- Java provides **concurrency mechanisms** (locks, atomic classes, concurrent collections, executor services) to avoid race conditions, deadlocks, etc.
    

👉 Example continued:

- Use `synchronized` or `ReentrantLock` on the bank account `withdraw()` method → ensures only one thread updates the balance at a time.
    
- Now the result is consistent (correct balance).
    

So:

- **Multithreading = multiple workers exist**.
    
- **Concurrency = making sure they work together without chaos**.

### 🔑 Quick Analogy

- Multithreading = having **10 cooks in a kitchen**.
    
- Concurrency = rules like “only one cook can use the stove at a time” or “use different chopping boards for veggies and meat”.  
    Without rules → chaos. With rules → order.

### 💻 In Java

- `Thread`, `Runnable` → multithreading.
    
- `synchronized`, `volatile`, `Lock`, `ExecutorService`, `ConcurrentHashMap` → concurrency.

👉 In short:

- **Multithreading = how to _create_ threads**.
    
- **Concurrency = how to _coordinate & manage_ threads safely**.
