Perfect! You’re **connecting this to the right concept** — it’s very similar to **handshake** in networking. Let's understand this in **very simple English** step-by-step.

---

## 🖐️ What is a Handshake in Networking?

> A **handshake** is like two computers saying:
> 
> “Hi! Are you real?” → “Yes, I am. Are you real too?” → “Okay, let’s talk safely.”

It's a process to **establish trust** and **start a secure communication**.

---

## 🤝 Types of Handshakes (Basic Overview)

|Type|Where it's Used|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**1-Way Handshake**|Server proves it’s real|Normal HTTPS website|
|**2-Way Handshake**|Both server and client prove they are real|SSH Login or SSL with client certificate|

---

## ✅ SSH = 2-Way Trust (but mostly one-sided handshake)

In **your case (SSH)**:

- **Only client (GitHub) is proving identity**
    
- Server just verifies using public key.
    

Let’s break it down with **your GitHub Actions example**:

### 🧱 Step-by-Step: SSH Authentication Handshake

```
[GitHub Actions]      ------------------->      [Linux Server]
    (starts connection)                             |
                                                   |
                    <--- sends a challenge message |
                                                   |
(encrypts challenge with private key)              |
        ------------------->                       |
                                                   |
(server verifies using public key)                 |
                                                   |
         <---- If verified, access is granted      |
```

### 🔐 What’s happening here?

- **GitHub (client)** uses **private key** → to prove “I am GitHub”
    
- **Linux Server** uses **public key** → to verify that it's really GitHub
    
- If check passes → connection is **trusted and secure**
    

> This is very much like a **handshake** before starting a conversation.

## 🤔 Why is it Needed?

Because:

- You don’t want **any random person** to deploy code to your server.
    
- You want to make sure: “Only GitHub with correct private key can connect.”
    

---

## 🔒 Secure Communication Starts _After_ the Handshake

Once this authentication handshake is successful:

- Now GitHub can securely copy files
    
- Or run deployment commands on your Linux server

## ✅ Summary (Simple Terms)

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|🤝 Handshake|A process where two systems say "Hello" and "Are you trusted?"|
|🛂 SSH Handshake|GitHub proves identity using private key|
|🔐 Server check|Server checks proof using the public key|
|✅ If matched|Connection is secure, and GitHub can deploy|
