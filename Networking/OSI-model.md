OSI stands for **Open Systems Interconnection**. It’s a **conceptual model** that helps us understand **how data travels** from one computer to another over a network.

## 🔹 What is OSI Model?

It is a **7-layer model**. Each layer has a specific job in handling the data during **sending or receiving**.

Think of it like a **parcel delivery system**:

- You write a letter (data),
    
- Put it in an envelope (packaging),
    
- The delivery team picks it up (routing),
    
- Delivers it to the correct address (destination).

## 🔹 OSI Model 7 Layers (Top to Bottom)

|Layer No.|Layer Name|Purpose (Simple English)|Industrial Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|7|Application|Interface for users to interact with network|Web browser, Gmail, WhatsApp|
|6|Presentation|Translates data (encrypt, decrypt, compress)|SSL/TLS encryption for secure websites (HTTPS)|
|5|Session|Opens and maintains a connection|Video call session, login sessions on websites|
|4|Transport|Breaks data into chunks, ensures error-free delivery|TCP (ensures complete file download)|
|3|Network|Finds best route to send data|Routers, IP addresses (like finding the address)|
|2|Data Link|Creates frames, handles errors in physical layer|MAC Address, Switches, Ethernet|
|1|Physical|Actual hardware sending data as bits (0s and 1s)|Cables, Wi-Fi, Network Cards|

## 🔁 How data flows?

When **you send a message**:

➡ It **starts from Layer 7 (Application)**  
➡ Goes down layer by layer to Layer 1 (Physical)  
➡ Sent over the network as bits (0s and 1s)  
➡ On receiving end, it goes **up** from Layer 1 to Layer 7

## 🏭 Real-World Example (Industry)

Let’s say you open a website: `www.amazon.com`

1. **Application (L7)** – You type URL in Chrome. Chrome is the application.
    
2. **Presentation (L6)** – It uses HTTPS, so your data is encrypted with SSL.
    
3. **Session (L5)** – A session is created between your PC and Amazon's server.
    
4. **Transport (L4)** – Data is broken into small packets using TCP.
    
5. **Network (L3)** – Your PC and Amazon find each other using IP addresses.
    
6. **Data Link (L2)** – Data is framed with MAC addresses for local delivery.
    
7. **Physical (L1)** – Bits are transmitted through cable or Wi-Fi.
