OSI stands for **Open Systems Interconnection**. It‚Äôs a **conceptual model** that helps us understand **how data travels** from one computer to another over a network.

## üîπ What is OSI Model?

It is a **7-layer model**. Each layer has a specific job in handling the data during **sending or receiving**.

Think of it like a **parcel delivery system**:

- You write a letter (data),
    
- Put it in an envelope (packaging),
    
- The delivery team picks it up (routing),
    
- Delivers it to the correct address (destination).

## üîπ OSI Model 7 Layers (Top to Bottom)

| Layer No. | Layer Name   | Purpose (Simple English)                             | Industrial Example                               |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 7         | Application  | Interface for users to interact with network         | Web browser, Gmail, WhatsApp                     |
| 6         | Presentation | Translates data (encrypt, decrypt, compress)         | SSL/TLS encryption for secure websites (HTTPS)   |
| 5         | Session      | Opens and maintains a connection                     | Video call session, login sessions on websites   |
| 4         | Transport    | Breaks data into chunks, ensures error-free delivery | TCP (ensures complete file download)             |
| 3         | Network      | Finds best route to send data                        | Routers, IP addresses (like finding the address) |
| 2         | Data Link    | Creates frames, handles errors in physical layer     | MAC Address, Switches, Ethernet                  |
| 1         | Physical     | Actual hardware sending data as bits (0s and 1s)     | Cables, Wi-Fi, Network Cards                     |

## üîÅ How data flows?

When **you send a message**:

‚û° It **starts from Layer 7 (Application)**  
‚û° Goes down layer by layer to Layer 1 (Physical)  
‚û° Sent over the network as bits (0s and 1s)  
‚û° On receiving end, it goes **up** from Layer 1 to Layer 7

## üè≠ Real-World Example (Industry)

Let‚Äôs say you open a website: `www.amazon.com`

1. **Application (L7)** ‚Äì You type URL in Chrome. Chrome is the application.
    
2. **Presentation (L6)** ‚Äì It uses HTTPS, so your data is encrypted with SSL.
    
3. **Session (L5)** ‚Äì A session is created between your PC and Amazon's server.
    
4. **Transport (L4)** ‚Äì Data is broken into small packets using TCP.
    
5. **Network (L3)** ‚Äì Your PC and Amazon find each other using IP addresses.
    
6. **Data Link (L2)** ‚Äì Data is framed with MAC addresses for local delivery.
    
7. **Physical (L1)** ‚Äì Bits are transmitted through cable or Wi-Fi.
