## ✅ 1. What is IP?

**IP = Internet Protocol**

- It is a set of rules used to **identify and locate devices** on a network.
    
- Every device (computer, mobile, server) that connects to the internet gets a **unique IP address**.
    

> 🟢 IP is like a **home address** for your device on the internet.

---

## ✅ 2. What is an IP Address?

An **IP Address** is a **unique number** given to each device in a network.  
It tells **where to send** and **where to receive** data.

### 🔍 Example:

```
192.168.1.5  → This is an IP address.
```

---

## ✅ 3. What is IPv4?

**IPv4 = Internet Protocol version 4**

- It uses **4 numbers** (called octets), separated by dots.
    
- Each number is from 0 to 255.
    
- Example: `192.168.1.1`
    

### 🔢 Structure:

```
[0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]
```

- Total possible addresses: ~**4.3 billion**
    
- Used commonly, but we are running out of IPv4 addresses.
    

---

## ✅ 4. What is IPv6?

**IPv6 = Internet Protocol version 6**

- New version of IP to solve the **shortage** of IPv4 addresses.
    
- Uses **128 bits**, written in hexadecimal (0–9 and a–f).
    
- Example:
    

```
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
```

### ✅ Why IPv6?

- **IPv4 limit**: 4.3 billion addresses
    
- **IPv6 limit**: 340 trillion trillion trillion! (enough for future)
    

---

## ✅ 5. What is Subnet?

**Subnet = Sub-Network**

- A **smaller group** inside a large network.
    
- Used to divide a big network into **smaller, manageable parts**.
    
- Each subnet has its **own range of IP addresses**.
    

> 🧠 Think of subnet like dividing a large apartment into **multiple flats**. Each flat (subnet) has different rooms (devices).

### 🔍 Example:

- IP: `192.168.1.0/24`
    
- This means: 256 IPs are in this subnet (from `.0` to `.255`)
    

---

## ✅ 6. How is IP Address Assigned to a Device?

There are **2 ways** to assign an IP address:

### 🅰️ Static IP:

- Manually set by user or network admin.
    
- Stays **fixed**.
    
- Used in servers, printers, etc.
    

### 🅱️ Dynamic IP:

- Assigned automatically by **DHCP server**.
    
- Changes every time you reconnect.
    
- Used in laptops, phones, etc.
    

### 📦 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- A service that **automatically gives IP addresses** to devices in a network.
    
- Like a receptionist giving you a room number in a hotel.

## 🔁 Summary Table:

|Term|Simple Meaning|Real Example|
|---|---|---|
|IP|Internet Protocol – identifies devices|Like your home address|
|IPv4|Older IP version (e.g., 192.168.1.1)|4 numbers separated by dots|
|IPv6|New IP version for more devices|Long hex address like `2001:...`|
|Subnet|Divides a network into smaller networks|Like flats in an apartment|
|DHCP|Automatically gives IP to devices|Like hotel receptionist|

---

## 🧠 You said:

> You connected your **laptop** and **mobile** to your **Wi-Fi (Jio Fiber)**, and both devices got the **same IP address**.

Let’s break it down.

---

## ✅ There are **two types** of IP addresses:

|Type|Used For|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Private IP**|Inside your home or local network|192.168.0.5|
|**Public IP**|Visible to the internet (outside)|49.36.XXX.XXX (Jio gives this)|

---

## 🏠 Inside Your Home Wi-Fi (Jio Fiber)

Your **router** does this:

1. Gets **one public IP** from Jio (e.g., `49.36.202.100`)
    
2. Then creates a **local network** (using subnet like `192.168.0.0/24`)
    
3. Assigns **different private IPs** to each device:
    

|Device|Private IP (Local)|Public IP (Internet side)|
|---|---|---|
|Laptop|192.168.0.101|49.36.202.100|
|Mobile|192.168.0.102|49.36.202.100|

✅ So even though **both devices share the same public IP**,  
they have **different private IPs** inside your Wi-Fi.

---

## 📦 How This Works?

Your router uses a method called:

### 🔄 **NAT (Network Address Translation)**

> NAT allows **multiple devices** inside your home to **share one public IP**.

💡 Think of NAT like a **reception desk in an office**:

- The office has **one official number** (public IP)
    
- But the receptionist routes calls to **different employees** (private IPs)
    

---

## ✅ So in your case:

- **Laptop and Mobile have same Public IP** → Because both use Jio Fiber router’s IP
    
- **Internally, they have different Private IPs** → Like `192.168.1.10` and `192.168.1.11`
    

---

## 🔍 How to Check This?

### On Laptop (Windows):

- Open Command Prompt → Type:
    

```
ipconfig
```

Look for:

- **IPv4 Address** → Your private IP
    
- **Default Gateway** → Your router’s IP (usually `192.168.x.1`)
    

### On Mobile:

- Go to Wi-Fi settings → Tap the connected Wi-Fi → Look for IP address
    

---

## 🔁 Summary:

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Private IP|Assigned to device inside home (Wi-Fi)|
|Public IP|Given by Jio to your home router|
|NAT|Allows many devices to share one public IP|
|Subnet|Divides local network (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24)|

Awesome! You're thinking like a network engineer now! 🌐  
Since you already imagine a network like a **tree**, let's now clearly explain how **Private IP** and **Public IP** addresses are assigned — using that **tree model**.

---

## ✅ Quick Recap:

In a network:

| IP Type        | Who Assigns It             | Used For                                 | Example       |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Public IP**  | ISP (e.g. Jio)             | Identifies your home to the **internet** | 49.36.202.100 |
| **Private IP** | Your **router** (via DHCP) | Identifies devices **inside your home**  | 192.168.0.101 |

---

## 🌳 Tree Analogy for IP Assignment

Let's build a tree step by step:

### 🔷 LEVEL 1: Internet (Root Node)

At the top, we have the **Internet**. IP addresses here are:

- **Public IPs**
    
- Managed globally by an organization called **IANA**
    

Example ranges:

- `49.36.202.100` → Jio owns this IP range
    

---

### 🔷 LEVEL 2: ISP (Jio Fiber)

Jio buys a **block of public IPs** from the global organization.  
Let’s say Jio owns:

```
49.36.202.0/24  → 256 public IPs
```

Jio then **assigns one of these** public IPs to your **home router**:

```
Your router gets: 49.36.202.100
```

---

### 🔷 LEVEL 3: Your Home Router (Private Subnet)

Now your router acts like a **sub-network root** (a smaller tree root).

It creates a **private IP network** like:

```
192.168.0.0/24 → 256 private IPs
```

Then your router assigns private IPs to your devices:

|Device|Private IP|
|---|---|
|Laptop|192.168.0.101|
|Mobile|192.168.0.102|
|Smart TV|192.168.0.103|

This assignment is usually done by **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** — which runs inside your router.

---

## 🌐 Summary of Tree Structure

```
[Internet Root]
    ↓
[Public IP Block owned by Jio] → 49.36.202.0/24
    ↓
[Your Router] → Gets 49.36.202.100
    ↓
[Your Private Network] → 192.168.0.0/24
   ├── Laptop → 192.168.0.101
   ├── Mobile → 192.168.0.102
   └── TV     → 192.168.0.103
```

## 🧠 Key Points to Remember:

| Concept          | Meaning                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Public IP**    | Given by ISP (e.g., Jio) to your router                |
| **Private IP**   | Given by your router to your devices                   |
| **DHCP**         | A service that assigns private IPs automatically       |
| **Tree analogy** | Public IP is root, private subnets are branches/leaves |
