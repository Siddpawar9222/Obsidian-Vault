## ✅ 1. What is IP?

**IP = Internet Protocol**

- It is a set of rules used to **identify and locate devices** on a network.
    
- Every device (computer, mobile, server) that connects to the internet gets a **unique IP address**.
    

> 🟢 IP is like a **home address** for your device on the internet.

---

## ✅ 2. What is an IP Address?

An **IP Address** is a **unique number** given to each device in a network.  
It tells **where to send** and **where to receive** data.

### 🔍 Example:

```
192.168.1.5  → This is an IP address.
```

---

## ✅ 3. What is IPv4?

**IPv4 = Internet Protocol version 4**

- It uses **4 numbers** (called octets), separated by dots.
    
- Each number is from 0 to 255.
    
- Example: `192.168.1.1`
    

### 🔢 Structure:

```
[0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]
```

- Total possible addresses: ~**4.3 billion**
    
- Used commonly, but we are running out of IPv4 addresses.
    

---

## ✅ 4. What is IPv6?

**IPv6 = Internet Protocol version 6**

- New version of IP to solve the **shortage** of IPv4 addresses.
    
- Uses **128 bits**, written in hexadecimal (0–9 and a–f).
    
- Example:
    

```
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
```

### ✅ Why IPv6?

- **IPv4 limit**: 4.3 billion addresses
    
- **IPv6 limit**: 340 trillion trillion trillion! (enough for future)
    

---

## ✅ 5. What is Subnet?

**Subnet = Sub-Network**

- A **smaller group** inside a large network.
    
- Used to divide a big network into **smaller, manageable parts**.
    
- Each subnet has its **own range of IP addresses**.
    

> 🧠 Think of subnet like dividing a large apartment into **multiple flats**. Each flat (subnet) has different rooms (devices).

### 🔍 Example:

- IP: `192.168.1.0/24`
    
- This means: 256 IPs are in this subnet (from `.0` to `.255`)
    

---

## ✅ 6. How is IP Address Assigned to a Device?

There are **2 ways** to assign an IP address:

### 🅰️ Static IP:

- Manually set by user or network admin.
    
- Stays **fixed**.
    
- Used in servers, printers, etc.
    

### 🅱️ Dynamic IP:

- Assigned automatically by **DHCP server**.
    
- Changes every time you reconnect.
    
- Used in laptops, phones, etc.
    

### 📦 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- A service that **automatically gives IP addresses** to devices in a network.
    
- Like a receptionist giving you a room number in a hotel.

| Term   | Simple Meaning                            | Real Example                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| IP     | Internet Protocol – identifies devices    | Like your home address           |
| IPv4   | Older IP version (e.g., 192.168.1.1)      | 4 numbers separated by dots      |
| IPv6   | New IP version for more devices           | Long hex address like `2001:...` |

## 🧠 You said:

> You connected your **laptop** and **mobile** to your **Wi-Fi (Jio Fiber)**, and both devices got the **same IP address**.

Let’s break it down.

---

## ✅ There are **two types** of IP addresses:

| Type           | Used For                          | Example                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Private IP** | Inside your home or local network | 192.168.0.5                    |
| **Public IP**  | Visible to the internet (outside) | 49.36.XXX.XXX (Jio gives this) |

---

## 🏠 Inside Your Home Wi-Fi (Jio Fiber)

Your **router** does this:

1. Gets **one public IP** from Jio (e.g., `49.36.202.100`)
    
2. Then creates a **local network** (using subnet like `192.168.0.0/24`)
    
3. Assigns **different private IPs** to each device:
    

|Device|Private IP (Local)|Public IP (Internet side)|
|---|---|---|
|Laptop|192.168.0.101|49.36.202.100|
|Mobile|192.168.0.102|49.36.202.100|

✅ So even though **both devices share the same public IP**,  
they have **different private IPs** inside your Wi-Fi.

---

## 📦 How This Works?

Your router uses a method called:

### 🔄 **NAT (Network Address Translation)**

> NAT allows **multiple devices** inside your home to **share one public IP**.

💡 Think of NAT like a **reception desk in an office**:

- The office has **one official number** (public IP)
    
- But the receptionist routes calls to **different employees** (private IPs)
    

---

## ✅ So in your case:

- **Laptop and Mobile have same Public IP** → Because both use Jio Fiber router’s IP
    
- **Internally, they have different Private IPs** → Like `192.168.1.10` and `192.168.1.11`
    

---

## 🔍 How to Check This?

### On Laptop (Windows):

- Open Command Prompt → Type:
    

```
ipconfig
```

Look for:

- **IPv4 Address** → Your private IP
    
- **Default Gateway** → Your router’s IP (usually `192.168.x.1`)
    

### On Mobile:

- Go to Wi-Fi settings → Tap the connected Wi-Fi → Look for IP address

## 🔁 Summary:

| Term       | Meaning                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Private IP | Assigned to device inside home (Wi-Fi)      |
| Public IP  | Given by Jio to your home router            |
| NAT        | Allows many devices to share one public IP  |
| Subnet     | Divides local network (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24) |

## ✅ What is a Subnet?

A **subnet** is a **subset of a bigger network**.  
In AWS, the **bigger network is the VPC**, and the **subnets are smaller networks inside it**.

Each subnet:

- Has its **own unique CIDR block** (IP range)
    
- Contains **non-overlapping IP addresses**
    
- Is either **public** or **private**
    

---

## ✅ Real-World Analogy

Imagine a big apartment building (VPC) divided into floors (subnets):

- **VPC**: Whole building
    
- **Subnet 1**: 1st floor (Rooms 101–150)
    
- **Subnet 2**: 2nd floor (Rooms 201–250)
    

Each floor (subnet) has **its own range** of room numbers (IP addresses).

---

## ✅ Example: Different IP Addresses in Each Subnet

Let’s say you created a VPC with range:

```
10.0.0.0/16   → Allows 65,536 IPs
```

Now you divide it into 2 subnets:

|Subnet Name|CIDR Block|Range of IPs|Public/Private|
|---|---|---|---|
|Subnet A|10.0.1.0/24|10.0.1.0 to 10.0.1.255|Public|
|Subnet B|10.0.2.0/24|10.0.2.0 to 10.0.2.255|Private|

So:

- EC2 in Subnet A might get IP: `10.0.1.10`
    
- EC2 in Subnet B might get IP: `10.0.2.15`
    

These IPs are **different** and come from their **own subnet ranges**.

---

## ✅ Key Rule

> **Each subnet must have a different, non-overlapping CIDR block.**

You cannot have:

- Subnet A: `10.0.1.0/24`
    
- Subnet B: `10.0.1.0/24` → ❌ Overlaps!
    

---

## ✅ Visual Tree (in your mental image style)

```
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
│
├── Subnet A: 10.0.1.0/24
│     └── EC2-A: 10.0.1.10
│
└── Subnet B: 10.0.2.0/24
      └── EC2-B: 10.0.2.15
```

Each EC2 is in a different **branch of the tree** (subnet), and gets IP from that branch’s range.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Yes, **each subnet has a different IP address range**
    
- The ranges are defined by **CIDR blocks** like `10.0.1.0/24`
    
- IPs given to EC2s come from that range
    
- This structure helps organize your cloud network properly
    
---

## ✅ First, What Jio Really Manages?

Jio provides:

- Internet to **millions of users**
    
- Each user may have multiple devices
    
- Each device needs an **IP address** to talk on the internet
    

Clearly, Jio needs a system to **manage these millions of devices**. That’s where **subnets** come in.

---

## ✅ How Jio Uses Subnets

### 1. **Jio owns a big block of public IP addresses**

They get these from global IP authorities (like APNIC for Asia).

Example:

```
Jio gets block: 49.36.0.0/14
```

That means they own IPs from:

```
49.36.0.0 → 49.39.255.255  (~262,144 IPs!)
```

---

### 2. **Jio divides that big IP block into smaller subnets**

Just like AWS divides VPC into subnets, Jio divides its block:

- Subnet A → For Mumbai users: `49.36.0.0/18`
    
- Subnet B → For Delhi users: `49.36.64.0/18`
    
- Subnet C → For Bangalore users: `49.36.128.0/18`
    
- ...
    

Each subnet serves a specific **region, tower, or type of service**.

---

### 3. **Jio assigns IPs to towers/routers**

Each Jio mobile tower or fiber router:

- Acts like a **mini-router**
    
- Has its own subnet range
    
- Assigns **private IPs** to user devices
    
- Uses **NAT** to connect them to the internet
    

Your devices might get:

- **Private IP**: `192.168.1.5` (from local Jio box/router)
    
- **Public IP**: `49.36.87.220` (Jio’s public subnet)
    

---

## ✅ Visual Example (Mental Tree)

```
Jio IP Block: 49.36.0.0/14
│
├── Mumbai Subnet: 49.36.0.0/18
│     └── Tower 1: assigns IPs to homes & phones
│
├── Delhi Subnet: 49.36.64.0/18
│     └── Tower 2: assigns IPs to devices there
│
└── Bangalore Subnet: 49.36.128.0/18
      └── Tower 3: assigns IPs to devices there
```
