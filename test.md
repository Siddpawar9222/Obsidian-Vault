###  ðŸ“˜ Spring Boot Learning ðŸ“˜

Recently, I explored **CI/CD** and successfully implemented it using **Spring Boot and GitHub Actions**. Hereâ€™s my journey:

âœ… **Started with AWS** â€“ Created a server, installed AWS CLI, and learned about **Elastic IP**.  
âœ… **Understood SSH** â€“ Learned how **private & public keys** work for secure connections.  
âœ… **Explored CI/CD** â€“ Understood the **concepts** and implemented it with **GitHub Actions**.  
âœ… **Two Ways to Implement CI/CD in GitHub Actions:**  
ðŸ”¹ **Self-Hosted Runner** â€“ Runs CI/CD directly on your own server.  
ðŸ”¹ **SSH Deployment** â€“ GitHub runner deploys via SSH.

I found **SSH Deployment** to be **easier and faster** for my setup! ðŸš€
