## Short direct answer (first)

👉 **Hibernate implements JPA, but Hibernate is OLDER than JPA**  
👉 **JPA is only a specification (rules)**  
👉 **Hibernate has its own native API + JPA API on top**

So:

> Hibernate components look different because **they are Hibernate-native**, not JPA-defined.

Now let’s break it properly 👇

---

## 1️⃣ First understand this clearly (MOST IMPORTANT)

### JPA vs Hibernate

| JPA                            | Hibernate                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Specification (rules)          | Implementation (actual code)         |
| Defines **WHAT methods exist** | Decides **HOW they work internally** |
| Does NOT give classes          | Gives real classes                   |
| Vendor-independent             | Vendor-specific                      |

👉 JPA does **not care** how Hibernate internally works.

---

## 2️⃣ Timeline (![[hibernate.png]]this clears confusion instantly 🧠)

### 📅 History

- Hibernate existed **before JPA**
    
- Later, Java introduced **JPA standard**
    
- Hibernate said:
    
    > “Okay, I’ll implement JPA”
    

But Hibernate **did NOT delete** its old architecture.

So now Hibernate has:

1. **Old (native) Hibernate API**
    
2. **New JPA API**
    

---

## 3️⃣ Why components look totally different?

Because you are comparing:

- 🟢 **Hibernate Native Architecture**
    
- 🔵 **JPA Architecture**
    

They solve the same problem but with **different names**.

---

## 4️⃣ Direct 1-to-1 mapping (VERY IMPORTANT)

Let’s map your diagram to JPA 👇

### 🔁 Hibernate vs JPA mapping

| Hibernate      | JPA                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Configuration  | Persistence Unit                |
| SessionFactory | EntityManagerFactory            |
| Session        | EntityManager                   |
| Transaction    | EntityTransaction               |
| Query          | Query                           |
| Criteria       | CriteriaBuilder / CriteriaQuery |

👉 SAME responsibility, different names.

---

## 5️⃣ Real-world analogy (BEST way to remember)

### Example: Payment rules 💳

- **JPA** = RBI rules
    
- **Hibernate** = HDFC bank
    

RBI says:

> “Support UPI, Cards, NetBanking”

HDFC may internally have:

- Old systems
    
- Extra APIs
    
- More features
    

But **as long as they follow RBI rules**, they are valid.

👉 Hibernate follows JPA rules  
👉 Hibernate can still have extra stuff

---

## 6️⃣ Why JPA did NOT force Hibernate to change internals?

Because:

- Breaking millions of applications ❌
    
- Hibernate already stable and optimized
    
- JPA only defines **public API**
    

So Hibernate:

- Keeps its architecture
    
- Adds JPA wrapper layer
    

---

## 7️⃣ Visual mental model (important)

```
Your Code
   ↓
JPA Interfaces (EntityManager, Query)
   ↓
Hibernate JPA Adapter
   ↓
Hibernate Core (Session, SessionFactory)
   ↓
Database
```

👉 JPA sits **on top**, not inside Hibernate.

---

## 8️⃣ Example to make it crystal clear

### JPA way (standard)

```java
@PersistenceContext
EntityManager em;
```

### Hibernate internally converts to:

```java
Session session = em.unwrap(Session.class);
```

👉 EntityManager is just a **wrapper**  
👉 Session does the real work

---

## 9️⃣ Important interview question (they LOVE this)

### Q: If Hibernate implements JPA, why Session still exists?

Answer:

> “Because Hibernate existed before JPA. Hibernate keeps its native API for advanced features and backward compatibility, while also implementing JPA as a standard interface.”

Perfect answer 💯

## 🔟 When should YOU use what?

| Situation                  | Use                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Normal project             | JPA (EntityManager / Repository) |
| Portability                | JPA                              |
| Hibernate-specific feature | Session                          |
| Spring Boot app            | Spring Data JPA                  |

👉 **90% cases → JPA**  
👉 **10% cases → Hibernate native**

---

## ✅ Final one-line takeaway

> **JPA defines rules, Hibernate follows rules but keeps its own engine.**
