Think about an online shopping website like Amazon. When you visit the site, you can move between different pages like the **Home page**, **Product page**, **Cart**, and **Checkout**. Each of these pages has its own content and URL, but they are all part of the same website.

Without `react-router-dom`, creating these different pages in a single-page React app would be very challenging. You’d have to write a lot of code to manage which components should show based on what the user clicked. The app would reload each time you wanted to show a new page, making it slower and not very user-friendly.

### How `react-router-dom` helps
Using `react-router-dom`, you can set up different routes (URLs) in your React app for each "page" without needing to reload the whole app. For example:
- `/home` shows the **Home** component
- `/product/123` shows the **Product** component for a product with ID `123`
- `/cart` shows the **Cart** component

### Real-World Example
Let’s say we’re building a food delivery app like Swiggy or DoorDash using React:
1. **Home Page** - Users see a list of restaurants when they first open the app.
2. **Restaurant Page** - When they click on a restaurant, it shows the menu, and the URL changes to `/restaurant/:id` (for example, `/restaurant/45`).
3. **Cart Page** - When they add items to the cart and go to checkout, the URL changes to `/cart`.

Each time a user navigates between these pages, `react-router-dom` handles showing the correct component (like Home, Restaurant, or Cart) **without refreshing the page**. This makes the app feel smooth and fast, almost like using a mobile app.
