### **1. What is SSH?**

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a method to connect **securely** to another computer (like a remote server) over the internet.

ðŸ’¡ Imagine **SSH as a remote control** for another computer.

- You **run commands** on your local machine,
- But they **execute on the remote server** (instead of your local machine).

This is useful for **deploying applications, managing servers, and transferring files** securely.

---

### **2. What is an SSH Key Pair (Private & Public Key)?**

SSH uses a **key pair** to establish a secure connection.  
There are **two types of keys**:

1. **Public Key (id_rsa.pub)** â†’ Shared with the remote server
2. **Private Key (id_rsa)** â†’ Kept secret on your local machine

ðŸ’¡ Think of it like a **lock and key system**:

- The **public key** is like a **lock** that you install on a door (remote server).
- The **private key** is like a **key** that fits only that lock.

ðŸ”’ **Security Rule**: Never share your **private key** with anyone!

---

### **3. Where Are These Keys Stored?**

When you generate an SSH key, it is stored in the `~/.ssh/` directory on your computer.

- **Linux/Mac Path:**
    
    ```bash
    ~/.ssh/
    ```
    
- **Windows Path:**
    
    ```bash
    C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\
    ```
    

Inside this folder, you will find:

- `id_rsa` â†’ **Private Key** (Keep this secret)
- `id_rsa.pub` â†’ **Public Key** (Can be shared with the server)

---

### **4. How to Generate an SSH Key?**

If you **don't have an SSH key**, you need to create one.

**Step 1: Open Terminal (Command Prompt for Windows) and Run:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
```

- `-t rsa` â†’ Uses the **RSA encryption algorithm**.
- `-b 4096` â†’ Generates a **strong** 4096-bit key.
- `-C "your-email@example.com"` â†’ Adds an email as a **label** for the key.

**Step 2: Press Enter to Save the Key**

```bash
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

Press **Enter** to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

**Step 3: Set a Passphrase (Optional)**

```bash
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
```

- You can press **Enter** to skip the passphrase (optional).

Once completed, you will see:

```bash
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
```

### **5. How to View Your SSH Keys?**

After generating keys, check if they exist:

ðŸ”¹ **Check your SSH private key:**

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

_(This should remain secret; do not share it.)_

ðŸ”¹ **Check your SSH public key:**

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

_(This key can be shared with remote servers.)_

### **6. How to Use SSH to Connect to a Server?**

Once you have your SSH keys, you can connect to a remote server.

ðŸ”¹ **Command to Connect to a Server**

```bash
ssh username@your-server-ip
```

- Replace `username` with your actual server username.
- Replace `your-server-ip` with your actual serverâ€™s IP address.

If this is your first time connecting, you might see:

```bash
The authenticity of host 'your-server-ip' can't be established.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

Type **yes** and press Enter.

If everything is set up correctly, you'll be **logged into the remote server**.

---

### **7. How to Add Your SSH Key to a Server?**

For passwordless login, you need to **add your public key** (`id_rsa.pub`) to the server.

**Step 1: Copy Your Public Key**  
On your local machine, run:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the entire output.

**Step 2: Add It to the Remote Server**  
Login to your remote server (using SSH with a password for now):

```bash
ssh username@your-server-ip
```

Once logged in, run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Paste your public key into this file.

Save and exit (Ctrl + X â†’ Y â†’ Enter).

Set correct permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Now, you can **log in without a password**:

```bash
ssh username@your-server-ip
```

 You can also specifies location of private key if above not worked 
 
```bash
ssh -i /path/to/private-key username@server-ip
```
