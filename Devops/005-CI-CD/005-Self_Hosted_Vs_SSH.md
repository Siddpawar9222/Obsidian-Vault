## **1. Self-Hosted Runner (CI/CD)**

✅ **What it is:**  
A **self-hosted runner** is a machine (server, PC, or cloud instance) that you set up to run your GitHub Actions workflow **instead of using GitHub’s default runners**.

✅ **How it works:**

- You install the **GitHub Actions runner** software on your own machine/server.
- When you push code to GitHub, the **CI/CD workflow runs directly on your server**.
- Your server fetches the code, builds, tests, and deploys the application.

✅ **Example Setup:**

- You register your server as a **GitHub Actions runner**.
- The workflow runs directly **on your server**.
- No need for SSH because your server already has access.

✅ **Advantages:**

- **Faster execution** (since you're using your own machine).
- **More control** (customize environment, install required tools).
- **Avoid GitHub's free-tier limits** (GitHub-hosted runners have limited free minutes).

✅ **Disadvantages:**

- You need to **manage and maintain the runner** (updates, security, downtime).
- If the runner crashes, your CI/CD process fails.

## **2. SSH-Based Deployment (CI/CD)**

✅ **What it is:**  
With SSH-based CI/CD, **GitHub Actions runs on GitHub's own servers** but **deploys** your application to a remote server **via SSH**.

✅ **How it works:**

- The **workflow runs on GitHub’s hosted runner**.
- GitHub **connects to your remote server via SSH**.
- It sends commands to fetch, build, and deploy the application.

✅ **Example Setup:**

- You **store the SSH private key** in GitHub Secrets (`SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`).
- The workflow runs **on GitHub’s cloud**, then connects via SSH to deploy.

✅ **Advantages:**

- **No need to maintain a runner** (GitHub handles it).
- Works **without exposing your server publicly** (just need SSH access).
- **More secure** (private keys can be rotated, access can be controlled).

✅ **Disadvantages:**

- **Slower** (GitHub’s hosted runner has to connect to your server).
- **SSH connection issues** may occur.
- You need to **store and manage SSH keys** securely.

## **Key Differences:**

|Feature|Self-Hosted Runner|SSH-Based Deployment|
|---|---|---|
|**Where the workflow runs**|On your own server|On GitHub’s runner|
|**Who manages the environment**|You|GitHub|
|**How code is deployed**|Directly on the same server|Over SSH to another server|
|**Speed**|Faster (no external connection)|Slower (SSH connection needed)|
|**Security**|You control everything|SSH keys must be managed securely|
|**Maintenance**|You maintain the server|Less maintenance needed|

### **Which One Should You Use?**

- Use **Self-Hosted Runner** if:  
    ✅ You **own a server** and want **full control** over the build environment.  
    ✅ You need **faster deployments** and **less reliance on GitHub’s resources**.  
    ✅ You want to **avoid GitHub’s free-tier limits** on Actions minutes.
    
- Use **SSH-Based Deployment** if:  
    ✅ You **don’t want to manage a runner** and want **GitHub to handle CI/CD**.  
    ✅ You are **deploying to a remote server** (e.g., VPS, cloud server).  
    ✅ You are okay with **slightly slower deployments** but want an **easier setup**.
