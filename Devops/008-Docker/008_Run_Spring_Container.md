### 🧱 Full Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk  
  
ARG WAR_FILE=target/*.war  
COPY ${WAR_FILE} app.war  
  
EXPOSE 8080  
  
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.war"]
```

---

### 🔍 Line-by-line Explanation

---

#### ✅ `FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk`

- This tells Docker:  
    **"Start with a base image that has Java 17 JDK installed."**
    
- `eclipse-temurin` is a trusted source for Java builds (like OpenJDK).
    
- Your Spring Boot app needs Java to run — this line provides it.
    

---

#### ✅ `ARG WAR_FILE=target/*.war`

- This is a variable: `JAR_FILE` holds the path of your jar file (like `target/myapp.jar`).
    
- `target/*.jar` means “any `.jar` file inside `target` folder”.
    
- It allows flexibility if the jar name changes (like with version numbers).
    

---

#### ✅ `COPY ${WAR_FILE} app.war`

- This command **copies your Spring Boot JAR file** from your local machine (host) into the Docker image.
    
- It renames it to `app.jar` inside the Docker image for simplicity.
    

---

#### ✅ `EXPOSE 8080`

- This tells Docker:  
    **"My app will run on port 8080 inside the container."**
    
- It doesn’t open the port on your computer — you do that using `-p 8080:8080` while running the container.
    

---

#### ✅ `ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.war"]`

- This is the **main command** to run when the container starts.
    
- It says:  
    **"Run this command: `java -jar app.war`"**
    
- It launches your Spring Boot app.

## How to  run  image: 

```
docker run -d --name container_name -p 8080:8080 image-name
```

## ✅ Accessing Jar File

---

### 🔒 1. **Firewall on EC2 / VPS / Server**

If you're hosting this app on AWS EC2 or any VPS, your server must allow traffic on port `8080`.

#### ✅ For AWS EC2:

Go to **Security Groups** in AWS:

- Edit **Inbound rules**
    
- Add a rule:
    
    - **Type**: Custom TCP
        
    - **Port**: 8080
        
    - **Source**: 0.0.0.0/0
        

> This opens port 8080 for all incoming traffic.

---

### 🐳 2. **Docker: Did you map port correctly?**

If your Spring Boot app is running in a **Docker container**, you must expose the port to the outside world:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name
```

If you forget `-p 8080:8080`, it will only be accessible **inside the container** (localhost).

---
## Why `-p 8080:8080` : 

### 📦 Docker container is like a box

When you run a container, it has its **own isolated network** — it’s like a private room. Even though your Spring Boot app is running inside the container on port `8080`, the **outside world can’t see it** unless you tell Docker to expose it.

---

### 🧠 Why `-p 8080:8080` is important

| Part        | Meaning                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| `-p`        | Publish or expose a port   |
| `8080:8080` | `HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT` |

---

### 📊 Example Breakdown:

|Host (your laptop / server)|Container (Spring Boot app inside Docker)|
|---|---|
|`localhost:8080`|Internal `8080` where Spring Boot runs|

So when you go to `http://65.0.86.28:8080` (host), Docker knows to **forward traffic** to the container's port `8080`.

---

### ❌ What if you don’t use `-p`?

If you run:

```bash
docker run your-image-name
```

➡️ Even if your app runs inside the container, the port **is not visible** to the host system.  
So accessing `http://localhost:8080` or your server IP won’t work.
