## 🧠 Core Docker Terminologies (with Simple Examples)

---

### 🐳 1. **Image**

📦 **What it is**: A **read-only template** used to create containers.  
Contains everything your app needs (code, Java, dependencies, config).

🧑‍💻 **Example**: `openjdk`, `mysql`, `ubuntu`, `nginx`, `springboot-app`

🧠 **Analogy**: Like a **class** in Java. It’s a blueprint — not running yet.

```bash
docker pull openjdk
```

---

### 🧱 2. **Container**

🚀 **What it is**: A **running instance of an image**

🧑‍💻 **Example**: When you run your Spring Boot app using Docker, it becomes a **container**.

🧠 **Analogy**: Like a **Java object** created from a class. It runs, does work, then can be stopped or deleted.

```bash
docker run openjdk
```

---

### 🏗️ 3. **Dockerfile**

📝 **What it is**: A **text file** with instructions to build your Docker image.

📄 Example content:

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17
COPY target/myapp.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

🧠 **Analogy**: Like a **build.gradle** or **pom.xml**, but for creating Docker images.

---

### 🔨 4. **Build**

🔧 **What it is**: The process of **creating an image** from a Dockerfile.

```bash
docker build -t my-spring-app .
```

🧠 **Analogy**: Like compiling your Java code into a `.class` file or `.jar`.

---

### 📛 5. **Tag**

🏷️ **What it is**: A **label** attached to an image, usually with a version.

```bash
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .
```

You can pull specific versions too:

```bash
docker pull mysql:8.0
```

🧠 **Analogy**: Like versioning in Git or Maven (`1.0`, `2.0-SNAPSHOT`, etc.)

---

### 📦 6. **Volume**

💾 **What it is**: A special storage space on your machine used by containers.

Useful when you want your **data to stay even after container is deleted.**

```bash
docker run -v myvolume:/data app
```

🧠 **Analogy**: Like a **folder on disk** connected to your app — even if your app crashes, the folder stays.

---

### 🌐 7. **Network**

🔌 **What it is**: Allows multiple containers to talk to each other.

🧑‍💻 Example: Your Spring Boot app (running in one container) talks to PostgreSQL (in another container) using a Docker **network**.

```bash
docker network create my-network
```

---

### 📋 8. **Docker Compose**

🧾 **What it is**: A YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) to define and run **multi-container** apps.

🧑‍💻 Example: You define Spring Boot + PostgreSQL + Redis in one file and run all together.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

🧠 **Analogy**: Like a **script that starts all services** at once for a full-stack app.

---

### 🏛️ 9. **Registry**

🌍 **What it is**: A **storage location** for Docker images (public or private)

- Example: **Docker Hub**
    
- You can **push** your image or **pull** others’
    

```bash
docker pull nginx
docker push your-username/your-app
```

🧠 **Analogy**: Like **GitHub**, but for Docker images.

---

### 👀 10. **Docker Daemon**

⚙️ **What it is**: The **engine that runs in background** and handles all Docker operations.

- It receives commands from the client (you) and creates images, runs containers, etc.
    

🧠 **Analogy**: Like the **JVM** that runs your Java app in the background.
