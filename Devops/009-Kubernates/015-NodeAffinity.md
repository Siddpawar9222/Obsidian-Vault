## 🔹 What is Node Affinity?

- **Node Affinity** is a rule that tells Kubernetes **which node(s)** your Pod should run on.
    
- Think of it like **"preferences" or "restrictions"** for where your Pod can be scheduled.
    

👉 Example analogy:  
Imagine you are a student and can attend classes in multiple campuses, but you prefer a campus **near your home**.

- **Affinity = preference/restriction**: “I want classes only in _Pune campus_” (required) or “I prefer Pune campus, but if not available, give me Mumbai” (preferred).

## 🔹 How does Kubernetes know about nodes?

Nodes have **labels**.  
For example:

```yaml
kubectl label nodes node1 disktype=ssd
kubectl label nodes node2 disktype=hdd
```

Now Kubernetes knows:

- `node1` has `disktype=ssd`
    
- `node2` has `disktype=hdd`

## 🔹 Types of Node Affinity

### 1. **RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**

- **Hard rule** → Pod will only run on nodes that match.
    
- If no node matches, Pod will stay in `Pending`.
    

Example:

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: disktype
          operator: In
          values:
          - ssd
```

👉 Pod will run **only on SSD nodes**.

---

### 2. **PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**

- **Soft rule** → Pod will try to go to the preferred node, but if not available, it will still run somewhere else.
    

Example:

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - weight: 1
      preference:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: disktype
          operator: In
          values:
          - ssd
```

👉 Pod **prefers SSD node**, but if not available, it will run on HDD too.

---

### 3. (Future - not fully supported)

**RequiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution**

- Means hard rule during scheduling **and** Pod must be evicted if rule breaks later. (Still alpha, not widely used).

## 🔹 Difference from NodeSelector

- `nodeSelector` → only supports **hard equality match** (`key=value`).
    
- `nodeAffinity` → more powerful, supports operators like `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist`, etc.
    

Example with operator:

```yaml
matchExpressions:
- key: zone
  operator: NotIn
  values:
  - us-east-1a
```

👉 Pod will run on all zones **except `us-east-1a`**.

---

## 🔹 Real-World Industrial Example

1. **SSD vs HDD**: Database Pods should always run on SSD nodes for faster disk I/O.
    
2. **Region/Zone**: Keep web servers in `us-east-1a` but database in `us-east-1b` (high availability).
    
3. **GPU Nodes**: AI/ML Pods must run only on GPU-enabled nodes.
    

---

✅ In short:

- **NodeSelector** → simple key=value filter.
    
- **Node Affinity** → flexible rules for where Pods can/can’t run.
    
- **Required** = must, **Preferred** = best effort.

👉 Do you want me to make a **YAML demo file with node affinity** (like with SSD vs HDD nodes) so you can try it directly?
