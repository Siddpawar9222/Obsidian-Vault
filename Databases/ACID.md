## 💡 What is ACID in Databases?

ACID is a set of **four rules** that help make sure **your database transactions are safe, correct, and reliable** — even when there's a crash or failure.

**A** — Atomicity  
**C** — Consistency  
**I** — Isolation  
**D** — Durability

Let’s understand each with a **real-world example:**

---

## 🏦 Example Scenario

> You are sending ₹1000 from **Siddhesh’s account** to **Rohan’s account**.

Steps:

1. Deduct ₹1000 from **Siddhesh's balance**
    
2. Add ₹1000 to **Rohan's balance**
    

---

### 1️⃣ **Atomicity** — _"All or Nothing"_

> 💥 Imagine app crashes after deducting ₹1000 from Siddhesh, but before adding it to Rohan.

Without atomicity:

- Siddhesh loses ₹1000 😓
    
- Rohan gets nothing
    
- 💔 Data becomes inconsistent
    

With atomicity:

- Either **both steps complete** ✅
    
- Or **neither happens** ❌
    
- So ₹1000 is **not lost in the middle**.
    

📌 Think of it as a **single unit** of work that must fully succeed or fully fail.

---

### 2️⃣ **Consistency** — _"Data must always follow rules"_

> The total money in the system should remain same.

If Siddhesh had ₹5000 and Rohan had ₹3000:  
Before: ₹5000 + ₹3000 = ₹8000  
After: ₹4000 + ₹4000 = ₹8000 ✅

Consistency ensures:

- <font color="#ffc000">No extra money is created</font>
    
- <font color="#ffc000">No rules (like balance can't go negative) are broken</font>

- 
    

---

### 3️⃣ **Isolation** — _"Transactions don’t disturb each other"_

> Imagine two people are transferring money at the same time.

Without isolation:

- Two transactions might **interfere** and read **half-updated data**.
    
- Siddhesh’s balance might become **wrong due to overlap**.
    

With isolation:

- Each transaction runs as if **it is the only one**.
    
- Others wait or work on their own data.
    

📌 Like locking a bank counter — one customer at a time.

---

### 4️⃣ **Durability** — _"Once done, it stays done"_

> After ₹1000 is transferred, the power goes off ⚡ or server crashes 💥.

Without durability:

- The transaction might be **lost**.
    

With durability:

- The transaction is **permanently saved**.
    
- Even after restart, Siddhesh still has ₹4000 and Rohan ₹4000.
    

📌 Think of it like writing to a **permanent ledger or file**.

## ✅ Summary with Example

|ACID Property|What It Ensures|In Our Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Atomicity**|All-or-nothing transaction|₹1000 deducted **and** credited, or nothing|
|**Consistency**|Database always valid|Total money stays same|
|**Isolation**|No interference from other operations|Two transfers won’t affect each other|
|**Durability**|Changes are permanent|After power off, money stays transferred|
