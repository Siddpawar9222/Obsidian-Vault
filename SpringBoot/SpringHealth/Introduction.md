## Why  ? 
### **Before Prometheus and Grafana: What Was the Problem?**

### 1. **No Visibility into Application Health**

- Developers had **no easy way to see** how the app was performing (CPU, memory, traffic).
    
- If something went wrong (like high memory usage), it was **hard to detect quickly**.
    

**Real-World Example:**  
Imagine your Spring Boot app is deployed, and users complain that it’s “slow.”  
But you don’t know why.  
Is it high traffic? Is the database slow? Is the server out of memory?  
You have to guess or check logs manually.

---

### 2. **Logs Were Not Enough**

- Logs are good, but they only show what **already happened**.
    
- You can’t easily create **charts** or monitor things like:
    
    - How many requests per second?
        
    - How much memory is used over time?
        
    - Is the app down right now?
        

---

### 3. **No Centralized Alerting System**

- Without alerts, you find problems only **after users complain**.
    
- You want to get **notified (email, Slack, etc.)** when something is wrong.
    
- Earlier, this required **custom scripts** or expensive tools.
    

---

### 4. **Too Many Servers, Too Much Data**

- In microservices or large systems, there are many services and instances.
    
- It becomes very hard to manually check each service’s health.
    
- You need a tool to **collect data automatically from all services.**

## **That’s Where Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager Help:**

|Problem|Tool|
|---|---|
|Need to collect metrics|**Prometheus**|
|Need to visualize data|**Grafana**|
|Need to get alerts|**Alertmanager**|

## **What is Spring Boot Actuator?**

Spring Boot Actuator is like a **health checker** and **info provider** for your Spring Boot app.

It exposes special **endpoints** like:

- `/actuator/health` → tells if app is up or down
    
- `/actuator/metrics` → gives basic metrics (memory, CPU, requests, etc.)
    
- `/actuator/info` → shows app info (version, build time, etc.)
    

But these are **raw data** — not beautiful dashboards or alerts.

---

## **How They Work Together (Real-World Example)**

1. **Spring Boot + Actuator**
    
    - You expose `/actuator/prometheus` which gives your app's metrics in Prometheus format.
        
2. **Prometheus**
    
    - It scrapes (collects) data from your app's `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint every few seconds.
        
    - Stores this data in time-series format.
        
3. **Grafana**
    
    - Connects to Prometheus and shows nice **charts and dashboards** using the collected data.
        
4. **Alertmanager**
    
    - Works with Prometheus to **send alerts** (like email or Slack) when something goes wrong (e.g., memory too high, app down).

## **Simple Analogy: Hospital Example**

|Tool|Role|
|---|---|
|Spring Actuator|Like a medical device showing heartbeat, temperature etc. (raw numbers)|
|Prometheus|The nurse who comes every minute to write down the readings|
|Grafana|The display board showing patient’s health charts over time|
|Alertmanager|The alarm system that notifies doctors if patient’s heart rate is too high|
