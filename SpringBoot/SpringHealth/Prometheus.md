## Expose Prometheus Endpoint:

- Add **Micrometer** (metrics library)
    
- Add **Spring Boot Actuator**
    
- Expose the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint
---

## üõ†Ô∏è What is Micrometer?

Micrometer is like a **bridge** between Spring Boot and Prometheus.  
It collects metrics from Spring Boot and **formats them for Prometheus**.

So when Prometheus scrapes your app, it understands the metrics.

Micrometer is a metrics collection library that acts as a facade(**simplified interface**) for various monitoring systems.¬†It provides a vendor-neutral API to instrument applications and export metrics to different backends like Prometheus, Datadog, and others.¬†In Spring Boot, Micrometer is integrated as the default metrics collection facility.¬†It enables developers to collect and monitor application performance data, such as request timings, resource usage, and custom metrics.

##  1. Add Dependencies (in `pom.xml` for Maven)

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- Spring Boot Actuator -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Micrometer for Prometheus -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
        <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Update `application.properties` or `application.yml`

For **`application.properties`**:

```properties
# Expose Prometheus endpoint  
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=prometheus,health,info  
# Prometheus path (default): /actuator/prometheus  
management.endpoint.prometheus.enabled=true
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Start Your Spring Boot App

Once you start the app, open this in your browser or use curl:

```
http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus
```

You will see **metrics in text format** like:

```
# HELP jvm_memory_used_bytes ...
jvm_memory_used_bytes{area="heap",...} 1234567.0
...
```

This means your app is now **ready to be scraped(collect)** by Prometheus!

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Test Other Actuator Endpoints (Optional)

You can also try:

- `http://localhost:8080/actuator/health` ‚Üí App health
    
- `http://localhost:8080/actuator/info` ‚Üí App info (you can configure custom info)
    

---

##  Install & Configure Prometheus on Windows:

- Install Prometheus on your Windows machine
    
- Configure it to collect data (scrape) from your Spring Boot app
    
- Run and test Prometheus
    

---

## Step 1: Download Prometheus

1. Go to the official Prometheus download page:  
    üëâ [https://prometheus.io/download/](https://prometheus.io/download/)
    
2. Under **"Prometheus Windows amd64"**, click on the `.zip` file to download it.
    
3. Extract the zip file to a folder, for example:  
    `C:\Tools\prometheus`
    

---

## Step 2: Configure Prometheus to scrape your Spring Boot app

1. Inside the extracted folder, open the file:  
    `prometheus.yml`
    
2. You‚Äôll see some default configuration.  
    Replace the contents with this:
    

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s  # Prometheus will collect data every 15 seconds

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spring-boot-app'
    metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']  # Use your Spring Boot app's host and port
```

 This tells Prometheus:

- Collect metrics every 15 seconds
    
- Go to `http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus` to collect data
    

---

##  Step 3: Run Prometheus

1. In the same folder, double-click the file `prometheus.exe`.
    
2. A black terminal window will open and Prometheus will start.
    
3. Open your browser and go to:  
    üëâ `http://localhost:9090`
    

You‚Äôll see the **Prometheus web UI**!

---

## Step 4: Test If It Works

1. Click on the **"Status" ‚Üí "Targets"** tab in the top menu.
    
2. You should see your Spring Boot app listed as a target:
    
    ```
    spring-boot-app | http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus | UP
    ```
    

If it says "UP", everything is working fine!  
Prometheus is **scraping your Spring Boot app** and **storing the data**.


---

## How to Check if Prometheus is Collecting Data

### üîç Step 1: Open Prometheus UI

Go to your browser and open:  
üëâ `http://localhost:9090`

---

### üß™ Step 2: Run a Query

In the **search bar at the top**, try typing the following metric name:

```
http_server_requests_seconds_count
```

Then click the **[Execute]** button.

---

### If data is being collected, you will see:

- A list of **results** below the search bar
    
- Each result has a label (like method="GET", status="200", uri="/", etc.)
    
- And a number ‚Äî that's the **count of HTTP requests**
    

It means Prometheus is successfully:

- Scraping metrics from your app
    
- Storing them
    
- Allowing you to query them

---

###  More Example Metrics You Can Try

|Metric Name|What It Means|
|---|---|
|`jvm_memory_used_bytes`|JVM memory used|
|`process_cpu_usage`|CPU usage of your app|
|`system_cpu_usage`|CPU usage of your system|
|`logback_events_total`|Log events (info, error, etc.)|
|`tomcat_threads_busy`|Number of busy Tomcat threads|
|`http_server_requests_seconds_sum`|Total response time|

Try typing any of these in the search box and click **Execute**.

---

### Optional: View the Graph

After running a query:

- Click the **[Graph]** tab (next to Table)
    
- You will see a time-series graph of that metric
