### 🟦 **1. What is Prometheus?**

**Prometheus** is a **monitoring tool**.  
Its job is to **collect and store metrics** (numbers) from your application at regular intervals.

📌 **Real-world example**:  
Imagine Prometheus as a **nurse** who checks your temperature and blood pressure every 10 seconds and writes it down in a notebook.

👨‍💻 In Spring Boot:

- You expose an endpoint: `/actuator/prometheus`
    
- Prometheus **reads** from it every few seconds (this is called **scraping**)
    

⏱️ Prometheus stores this data in **time-series format** — i.e., numbers over time.

### 🟩 **2. What is Grafana?**

**Grafana** is a **visualization tool**.  
It takes data from Prometheus and shows it as beautiful **charts, graphs, dashboards**.

📌 **Real-world example**:  
Grafana is like the **screen in ICU** that shows a patient’s heartbeat and oxygen level in real-time graphs.

👨‍💻 In DevOps:

- You connect Grafana to Prometheus.
    
- Create dashboards like:
    
    - Request count over time
        
    - Memory usage graph
        
    - Uptime % graph
        

It helps **developers** and **ops teams** easily see what’s happening.

### 🟥 **3. What is Alertmanager?**

**Alertmanager** is a **notification tool**.  
It sends **alerts** (emails, Slack messages, etc.) when Prometheus detects something wrong.

📌 **Real-world example**:  
Alertmanager is like the **emergency alarm system** in a hospital.  
If the patient's heart rate is too high, an alert goes to the doctor.

👨‍💻 In your app:

- You define alert rules in Prometheus (e.g., “If memory usage > 80%”)
    
- Alertmanager sends alerts via:
    
    - Email
        
    - Slack
        
    - PagerDuty
        
    - Telegram, etc.

## 🤝 How They Work Together

Here’s how they connect step by step:

1. **Spring Boot Actuator** exposes metrics → `/actuator/prometheus`
    
2. **Prometheus** collects (scrapes) data from it regularly
    
3. **Grafana** uses Prometheus data to show charts and dashboards
    
4. **Alertmanager** works with Prometheus to send alerts when thresholds are crossed
    

```
Spring Boot + Actuator ──> Prometheus ──> Grafana (for visuals)
                                     │
                                     └──> Alertmanager (for alerts)
```
