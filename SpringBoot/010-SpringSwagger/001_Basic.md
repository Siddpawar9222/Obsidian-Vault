### OpenAPI Specification

OpenAPI Specification <font color="#ffff00">(OAS) is a standard format used to describe RESTful APIs.</font> It provides a way to define your API’s endpoints, request/response formats, parameters, and other details in a machine-readable format, typically in JSON or YAML. It helps both developers and machines understand how to interact with your API.

#### Key Components of OpenAPI:
1. **Paths (Endpoints):** These are the URLs where the API can be accessed, like `/users` or `/products/{id}`.
2. **HTTP Methods:** Defines the actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) you can perform on the paths.
3. **Request/Response Bodies:** Describes what data needs to be sent to the API (in the request) and what data the API returns (in the response).
4. **Parameters:** These are inputs you provide in requests, like query parameters (`?name=value`), headers, or path parameters (`/users/{id}`).
5. **Schemas:** Defines the structure of data, like what fields and types are in an object.


If you wanted to get details of a product with the ID `123`, the request would be:
```
GET /products/123
```

The response could look like this:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Smartphone",
  "price": 299.99
}
```

This describes the API interaction, how to call it, and what kind of response to expect!

#### Why Use OpenAPI?
- **Documentation:** It generates easy-to-read documentation for developers using your API.
- **Automation:** Tools like Swagger can automatically generate client libraries, server stubs, and even test cases from OpenAPI definitions.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that your API is well-documented and easier to maintain.

### Swagger : 

Swagger is a set of tools that helps you **design**, **build**, **document**, and **test** RESTful APIs. It uses (implements) the **OpenAPI Specification** (OAS) to describe the structure of your APIs in a standardized way. With Swagger, you can automatically generate interactive API documentation from your code, making it easy for developers and users to understand and interact with the APIs.

In simpler terms:
- **OAS (OpenAPI Specification)** is the standard that defines how APIs should be described.
- **Swagger** is the set of tools (like Swagger UI and Swagger Codegen) that help you automatically generate, document, and interact with your API based on the OpenAPI specification.


### How to integrate swagger in spring boot ? 

**Springfox** and **SpringDoc OpenAPI** are two popular libraries <font color="#ffff00">used to integrate</font> **Swagger/OpenAPI** into **Spring Boot** applications, but they differ in how they support Swagger and OpenAPI Specification (OAS). Let’s explore both and highlight the key differences.

### 1. **Springfox**
**Springfox** was one of the most widely used libraries for generating Swagger documentation in Spring applications. It provides a way to automatically generate Swagger 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.0 documentation from your Spring controllers and models.

### 2. **SpringDoc OpenAPI**
**SpringDoc OpenAPI** is a more modern and actively maintained library that focuses on supporting the **OpenAPI 3.0** specification in Spring Boot applications. It offers better integration with newer Spring Boot versions and provides richer support for OpenAPI features.

Here's a table highlighting the key differences between **Springfox** and **SpringDoc OpenAPI**:

| **Feature**                  | **Springfox**                                      | **SpringDoc OpenAPI**                                         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Swagger/OpenAPI Version**  | Primarily Swagger 2.0 (partial OpenAPI 3.0)        | Full support for OpenAPI 3.0                                  |
| **Maintenance**              | Limited updates and maintenance                    | Actively maintained with regular updates                      |
| **Spring Boot Integration**  | Basic Spring Boot support                          | Native and seamless integration with Spring Boot              |
| **Configuration Complexity** | Requires more manual configuration                 | Requires minimal configuration (auto-configures)              |
| **Annotations Used**         | Uses Swagger annotations (`@Api`, `@ApiOperation`) | Uses standard Spring annotations (`@Operation`, `@Parameter`) |
| **Swagger UI**               | Provides Swagger UI for interaction                | Provides both Swagger UI and OpenAPI UI                       |
| **Kotlin Support**           | Limited or no Kotlin support                       | Full support for Kotlin                                       |
| **WebFlux/Reactive Support** | Basic support for reactive programming             | Full support for WebFlux and reactive programming             |
| **OpenAPI Spec Generation**  | Partial support for OpenAPI 3.0                    | Full and native support for OpenAPI 3.0                       |
| **Community & Ecosystem**    | Older, larger user base but declining              | Newer, growing user base with strong adoption                 |
| **Ease of Use**              | More setup required                                | Easier to use with Spring Boot auto-configuration             |
