## 🗂️ **Microservices with Spring Boot – Complete Syllabus**

---

### 📘 **1. Core Concepts of Microservices**

- What are Microservices?
    
- Monolithic vs Microservices architecture
    
- Advantages and disadvantages
    
- Real-world use cases (Netflix, Amazon)
    
- Basic design principles:
    
    - Single responsibility
        
    - Decentralized data
        
    - Independent deployability
        
    - Loose coupling & High cohesion
        

---

### ⚙️ **2. Setting Up Your Environment**

- Install Java 17+ and Spring Boot
    
- Setup IDE (IntelliJ IDEA)
    
- Install Postman for API testing
    
- Install MySQL/PostgreSQL (for database)
    
- Install Docker & Docker Compose
    
- Optional: RabbitMQ/Kafka UI for event management
    

---

### 🚀 **3. Spring Boot Fundamentals**

- Create a Spring Boot project with Spring Initializr
    
- Basic REST API with:
    
    - Controllers
        
    - Services
        
    - Repositories
        
- CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA
    
- Validation using `@Valid`, `@NotNull`, etc.
    

---

### 📦 **4. Microservices Architecture Design**

- Identifying services (User, Order, Payment, etc.)
    
- Communication between services:
    
    - Synchronous (REST)
        
    - Asynchronous (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
        
- API Gateway and Service Registry introduction
    

---

### 🔄 **5. Service-to-Service Communication**

- ✅ REST Template (Deprecated)
    
- ✅ WebClient (Reactive - modern way)
    
- ✅ Feign Client (Declarative REST client)
    
- Load balancing with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer
    

---

### 🧾 **6. Spring Cloud Essentials**

- Spring Cloud Config (Centralized config management)
    
- Eureka Server (Service registry)
    
- Spring Cloud Gateway (API gateway)
    
- Circuit Breaker & Resilience4j (fault tolerance)
    
- Retry, Rate Limiting, and Timeout handling
    

---

### 🔐 **7. Security in Microservices**

- Spring Security basics
    
- Stateless authentication with JWT
    
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
    
- Secure API Gateway with JWT
    
- OAuth2 (Google, GitHub login using Spring Security)
    

---

### 🧪 **8. Testing Microservices**

- Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito
    
- Integration Testing with TestContainers
    
- Mock external services using WireMock
    
- Test REST endpoints with Postman
    

---

### 💽 **9. Database and Persistence**

- Database per service pattern
    
- PostgreSQL/MySQL configuration
    
- Flyway or Liquibase for versioned migrations
    
- JPA & Hibernate relationships (OneToMany, ManyToOne)
    

---

### 📬 **10. Event-Driven Communication**

- Introduction to message brokers
    
- RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka integration
    
- Use cases: Order → Payment → Inventory flow
    
- Asynchronous message handling with Spring AMQP or Kafka Streams
    

---

### 📊 **11. Monitoring & Observability**

- Spring Boot Actuator (built-in metrics)
    
- Micrometer integration
    
- Prometheus for monitoring
    
- Grafana for visual dashboards
    
- Centralized logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
    

---

### 🛠️ **12. Docker & Deployment**

- Dockerize each microservice
    
- Docker Compose for local orchestration
    
- Writing Dockerfile for Spring Boot
    
- Deploy to:
    
    - Local machine
        
    - Cloud (AWS EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk)
        
    - Kubernetes (optional/advanced)
        

---

### 🌐 **13. API Gateway Advanced**

- Route configuration
    
- Path rewriting
    
- Rate limiting
    
- Custom Filters (Logging, Authentication)
    
- CORS handling
    

---

### 📁 **14. Real-World Projects**

- Project 1: E-commerce System
    
    - Services: User, Product, Order, Payment
        
    - Features: JWT Auth, Gateway, Eureka, RabbitMQ
        
- Project 2: Online Learning Platform (LMS)
    
    - Features: OAuth2 login, Config Server, Central Logging, Circuit Breaker
        

---

### 🧠 **15. Best Practices & Design Patterns**

- DTO, Mapper, Builder Pattern
    
- OpenAPI / Swagger Documentation
    
- Config-driven approach
    
- Error handling with custom exceptions
