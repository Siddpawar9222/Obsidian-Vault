`@RequestMapping`:
The `@RequestMapping` annotation is used in Spring to map web requests to specific controller methods. It's a versatile annotation that allows you to specify how various HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are mapped to methods in your controller. This annotation can be applied at both the class level and the method level.

Here's how you can use the `@RequestMapping` annotation:

1. **Class Level Mapping**: You can use `@RequestMapping` at the class level to define a base URL for all methods in the controller. This base URL is used as a prefix for all endpoint mappings within that controller.

    ```java
    @RequestMapping("/api")
    public class MyController {
    }
    ```

2. **Method Level Mapping**: You can use `@RequestMapping` at the method level to specify the relative URL for a specific method. This URL is appended to the base URL defined at the class level.

    ```java
    @RequestMapping(value = "/register", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public String createResource() {
    }
    ```

The `@RequestMapping` annotation provides a flexible way to define the routing and behavior of your controller methods. Depending on the Spring version you are using, you can use the more specialized annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc., to enhance the readability of your code and make it more concise.

- `@GetMapping`: This annotation is a shortcut for mapping HTTP GET requests to specific controller methods. It's equivalent to `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`.

- `@PostMapping`: This annotation is a shortcut for mapping HTTP POST requests to specific controller methods. It's equivalent to `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)`.

- `@PutMapping`: This annotation is a shortcut for mapping HTTP PUT requests to specific controller methods. It's equivalent to `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT)`.

- `@DeleteMapping`: This annotation is a shortcut for mapping HTTP DELETE requests to specific controller methods. It's equivalent to `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE)`.

**PUT vs PATCH**:

- When you send a PUT request, you are typically replacing the entire resource even if you send a subset of the resource for an update. It also creates the resource if it doesn't exist.

- Unlike PUT, PATCH is designed for partial updates. It allows you to update specific fields or properties of a resource without affecting the rest of the resource. It gives an error if the resource doesn't exist.

- `@RequestBody`: This annotation is used to indicate that a method parameter should be bound to the body of the HTTP request. It's commonly used to receive and parse JSON or XML data sent in the request body.

- `@PathVariable`: This annotation is used to bind a method parameter to a template variable in the URL path. It allows you to extract values from the URL and use them as method arguments.

    ```
    http://localhost:8080/api/users/123
    ```

- `@RequestParam`: This annotation is used to bind a method parameter to a query parameter in the URL. It allows you to access values sent as query parameters in the request.

    ```
    http://localhost:8080/api/users/info?id=456&name=John
    ```

   `@PathVariable` is used to retrieve detailed user profiles by ID, and `@RequestParam` is used to retrieve basic user information with optional parameters (filter the information).

  - `consumes` and `produces: You can use the `consumes` and `produces` attributes of `@RequestMapping` to specify the media types the controller method can consume or produce.

    ```java
    @PostMapping(path = "/create", consumes = "application/json", produces = "application/json")
    public ResponseEntity<String> createResource(@RequestBody MyDto dto) {
    }
    ```
