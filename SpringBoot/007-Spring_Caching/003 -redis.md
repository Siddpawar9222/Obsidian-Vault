`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install redis-server`
`sudo service redis-server start`
`redis-cli`
 `PING` 
 `SET keyName`
 `GET keyName`
 `DEL KeyName`
 `KEYS *`

type ping you should get pong



Install Redis on windows
Try to create and get key-value pair through spring boot but didnt works , because 
spring boot and redis use default seializable and deseializable.







/*  
Lettuce is a popular Redis client that is fully non-blocking and supports advanced Redis features like cluster mode, Sentinel, and asynchronous communication. It's known for its performance and scalability.  
  
LettuceConnectionFactory:  
This factory uses the Lettuce client to create and manage Redis connections.  
By default, it connects to Redis using the default settings (localhost on port 6379). However, you can customize these settings by configuring the LettuceConnectionFactory (e.g., setting the Redis server hostname, port, password, etc.).  
  
RedisTemplate:  
This is a Spring Data Redis template that uses the Lettuce connection factory to create and manage Redis connections.

A **Redis client** is a software library or tool that allows applications to interact with a Redis server. Redis clients provide the necessary functionality to connect to Redis, send commands, and receive responses, enabling developers to use Redis as a data store, cache, or message broker in their applications.

### Key Functions of a Redis Client:

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Redis clients handle establishing and maintaining connections to a Redis server. This includes handling network communication, authentication, and connection pooling.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - Clients provide methods to execute Redis commands (e.g., GET, SET, HSET, LPUSH) from within the application code. The client translates these method calls into Redis protocol commands and sends them to the server.

3. **Serialization/Deserialization**:
   - Redis clients often handle the conversion of application data into a format suitable for storage in Redis (serialization) and the conversion of Redis data back into application-specific objects (deserialization).

4. **Asynchronous and Synchronous Communication**:
   - Some Redis clients support both synchronous and asynchronous communication with Redis. Synchronous operations wait for a response before proceeding, while asynchronous operations allow other tasks to continue while waiting for the Redis server's response.

5. **Advanced Features**:
   - Depending on the client, there may be support for advanced Redis features like Pub/Sub messaging, Redis transactions, Lua scripting, Redis Cluster, and Sentinel (for high availability).

### Common Redis Clients

Here are a few popular Redis clients used in various programming languages:

- **Java**:
  - **Jedis**: A popular, straightforward, and synchronous Redis client for Java.
  - **Lettuce**: A scalable, thread-safe, and non-blocking Redis client that supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication.
  
- **Python**:
  - **redis-py**: The most popular Redis client for Python, providing a simple and intuitive API.
  
- **Node.js**:
  - **node-redis**: A high-performance Redis client for Node.js that supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
  
- **.NET**:
  - **StackExchange.Redis**: A high-performance Redis client for .NET, developed by the team behind Stack Overflow.

### Example: Lettuce Redis Client in Java

```java
import io.lettuce.core.RedisClient;
import io.lettuce.core.api.StatefulRedisConnection;
import io.lettuce.core.api.sync.RedisCommands;

public class RedisExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RedisClient redisClient = RedisClient.create("redis://localhost:6379");
        StatefulRedisConnection<String, String> connection = redisClient.connect();
        RedisCommands<String, String> syncCommands = connection.sync();

        syncCommands.set("key", "value");
        String value = syncCommands.get("key");
        System.out.println("Stored value: " + value);

        connection.close();
        redisClient.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Summary:
- **Redis clients** are essential tools for enabling applications to communicate with a Redis server.
- They abstract the complexity of the Redis protocol, providing a simple API for developers to perform operations like setting and getting values, handling data serialization, and managing connections.
- The choice of Redis client often depends on the programming language being used and the specific needs of the application (e.g., synchronous vs. asynchronous communication).

üåüSpring Boot Caching- Part1üåü

  

Started Learning Spring Cache and I have learned in-memory Spring caching. Here's a quick breakdown of what I did:

  

‚úÖ Started with the basics of caching, learning about different types of caching.

‚úÖ Implemented caching in a Spring Boot project.

‚úÖ Learned about important annotations like @EnableCaching, @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict.

‚úÖ Confirmed caching by creating an API that lists all available caches.

  

Additionally, I earned the July LeetCode Badge for my consistent efforts! üèÖ

 **Today‚Äôs Learning: Spring Boot Caching with Redis** 

Today, I learned how to use **Spring Boot caching** with **Redis**! 

 **Step 1:** I started by setting up Redis on my Windows computer. I did this by installing Linux on Windows and then setting up Redis. 

 **Step 2:** Next, I connected Redis to my Spring Boot app by using a simple string serializer. üõ†Ô∏è

 **Step 3:** Finally, I configured my Spring Boot app to use caching with the `@Cacheable` annotation and tested the APIs. It was amazing to see how much faster everything was with caching compared to without it! ‚ö°
