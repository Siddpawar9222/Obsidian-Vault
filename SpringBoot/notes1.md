Removing a test user will block them from signing into your OAuth app until you set your app's publishing status to "In production" or re-add their Google account as a test user.

Test users that you remove from your app will still count against the allowed user cap.



The reason your Spring Boot application doesn't ask for authentication again after you authenticate the first time is that OAuth 2.0 uses **access tokens** and **refresh tokens** to maintain the session, and the tokens are cached locally. Here's a breakdown of why this happens and how you can control the authentication process:

### Why it Happens
1. **Access Token & Refresh Token**:
   - When you first authenticate, Google provides an access token that allows your app to interact with Google Drive on the user's behalf.
   - Google also issues a **refresh token** if you've set the `access_type=offline` parameter, which allows your app to automatically refresh the access token when it expires without needing user interaction.
   
2. **Token Caching**:
   - Your app is storing the access token (and possibly the refresh token) somewhere, so the next time you start the app, it reuses the stored tokens, which is why it doesn't ask for reauthentication.
   - Tokens are typically cached in a file, database, or in-memory store by the OAuth library you're using.

### Controlling Authentication Behavior
If you want your application to ask for authentication each time, or if you want to handle token expiration manually, you can take the following steps:

#### 1. **Delete the Cached Tokens Manually** (For Testing)
   If you're storing the token locally (in a file or database), you can manually delete the cached token. For example, if you're using a file-based token store, look for a `.tokens` or similar file in your project and delete it to force reauthentication.

#### 2. **Force Reauthorization by Adding `prompt=consent` to OAuth URL**
   If you want to force Google to reauthorize every time, you can modify the OAuth URL by adding `prompt=consent`. This forces Google to ask for the user’s consent again, even if the tokens exist.

   Example URL:
   ```text
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?access_type=offline&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8888/Callback&response_type=code&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive&prompt=consent
   ```

   The `prompt=consent` parameter will ensure that the user is prompted for consent every time, even if they have already granted access previously.

#### 3. **Use `access_type=online`** (Optional)
   If you don't want a refresh token to be generated (forcing the user to reauthenticate when the access token expires), you can use `access_type=online` instead of `offline`:

   Example:
   ```text
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?access_type=online&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8888/Callback&response_type=code&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
   ```

   In this case, Google will not generate a refresh token, and after the access token expires (typically after 1 hour), the user will need to reauthenticate.

#### 4. **Configure Token Expiration**
   You can handle token expiration manually by checking whether the token has expired and prompting the user to reauthenticate if necessary. Here’s an example of checking for token expiration in your code:

   ```java
   GoogleCredentials credentials = GoogleCredentials.fromStream(new FileInputStream("path/to/credentials.json"))
           .createScoped(Collections.singletonList(DriveScopes.DRIVE));

   // Check if the token has expired and refresh if needed
   if (credentials.refreshIfExpired()) {
       System.out.println("Token was expired and has been refreshed.");
   } else {
       System.out.println("Token is still valid.");
   }
   ```

   If the token is expired, it will automatically refresh the token using the refresh token. If you want the user to be forced to authenticate again, you can avoid refreshing the token and instead prompt for reauthorization.

### Summary:
- **Token Caching**: Your app reuses stored access and refresh tokens, so it doesn’t prompt for authentication again.
- **Force Authentication**: Add `prompt=consent` to the OAuth URL to force the user to authenticate each time.
- **Delete Cached Tokens**: If you're caching tokens locally (in a file or database), delete them to force reauthentication.
- **Optional**: Use `access_type=online` if you don’t want a refresh token to be issued and want the user to reauthenticate after the token expires.
