Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development to implement Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class in various ways. Here are the types of Dependency Injection:

1. **Constructor Injection**:
   - Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
   - It's the most commonly used type of DI and ensures that a class is always initialized with its dependencies.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public class Service {
       private final Repository repository;

       @Autowired
       public Service(Repository repository) {
           this.repository = repository;
       }

       // other methods
   }
   ```

2. **Setter Injection**:
   - Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
   - It allows changing dependencies even after the object is constructed.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public class Service {
       private Repository repository;

       @Autowired
       public void setRepository(Repository repository) {
           this.repository = repository;
       }

       // other methods
   }
   ```

3. **Field Injection**:
   - Dependencies are provided directly into fields using annotations.
   - This method is the least preferred because it makes testing and refactoring harder.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public class Service {
       @Autowired
       private Repository repository;

       // other methods
   }
   ```

4. **Interface Injection** (Not commonly used in Spring):
   - The dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it.
   - It's not directly supported by Spring and is rarely used.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public interface Inject {
       void injectDependency(Service service);
   }

   public class RepositoryInjector implements Inject {
       @Override
       public void injectDependency(Service service) {
           service.setRepository(new Repository());
       }
   }
   ```

##### In Spring Framework, constructor and setter injections are widely used. 

### Why Constructor Injection is Generally Preferred?

Constructor injection vs. Setter injection:  
If you want to instantiate a class, you always do it with its constructor. So, if you are using constructor-based injection, the only way to instantiate the class is through that constructor. If you pass the dependency through the constructor, it becomes evident that it is a mandatory dependency.

On the other hand, if you have a setter method in a POJO class, you may or may not set a value for your class variable using that setter method. It is completely based on your need, i.e., it is optional. So, if you pass the dependency through the setter method of a class, it implicitly means that it is an optional dependency.

### Constructor Injection vs. Field Injection

- **Constructor Injection**:  
  Allows dependencies to be `final`, ensuring they are not changed after construction (avoiding accidental reassignment).

- **Field Injection**:  
  Field injection doesn’t allow the use of `final` for injected dependencies, reducing the assurance that these fields won’t be altered later.
