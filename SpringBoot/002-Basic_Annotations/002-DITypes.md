Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development to implement Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class in various ways. Here are the types of Dependency Injection:

1. **Constructor Injection**:
   - Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
   - It's the most commonly used type of DI and ensures that a class is always initialized with its dependencies.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public class Service {
       private final Repository repository;

       @Autowired
       public Service(Repository repository) {
           this.repository = repository;
       }

       // other methods
   }
   ```

2. **Setter Injection**:
   - Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
   - It allows changing dependencies even after the object is constructed.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public class Service {
       private Repository repository;

       @Autowired
       public void setRepository(Repository repository) {
           this.repository = repository;
       }

       // other methods
   }
   ```

3. **Field Injection**:
   - Dependencies are provided directly into fields using annotations.
   - This method is the least preferred because it makes testing and refactoring harder.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public class Service {
       @Autowired
       private Repository repository;

       // other methods
   }
   ```

4. **Interface Injection** (Not commonly used in Spring):
   - The dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it.
   - It's not directly supported by Spring and is rarely used.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public interface Inject {
       void injectDependency(Service service);
   }

   public class RepositoryInjector implements Inject {
       @Override
       public void injectDependency(Service service) {
           service.setRepository(new Repository());
       }
   }
   ```

In Spring Framework, constructor and setter injections are widely used. Constructor injection is generally preferred because it makes the dependency requirements of a class explicit and ensures that the class is always in a valid state after construction. Setter injection is useful for optional dependencies or when the dependencies need to be changed after the object is constructed. Field injection is quick and convenient but should be used with caution due to potential issues with testing and immutability.
