#### **What is Let’s Encrypt?**

🔹 **Let’s Encrypt** is a **free** and **automated** certificate authority (CA) that provides **SSL/TLS certificates** to enable **HTTPS** on websites.  
🔹 It is trusted by major companies like **Google, Mozilla, Cisco, and Facebook**.  
🔹 It allows businesses to secure their websites **without paying** for an SSL certificate.

✅ **Example**:  
Imagine you are launching an **e-commerce website** for your startup. Instead of paying ₹5000–₹10,000 per year for an SSL certificate from GoDaddy, you can use **Let’s Encrypt for free**.

### **How Let’s Encrypt Works?**

🔹 **Step 1**: The website owner requests an SSL certificate from Let’s Encrypt.  
🔹 **Step 2**: Let’s Encrypt verifies that the owner controls the domain (e.g., `example.com`).  
🔹 **Step 3**: If verification is successful, Let’s Encrypt issues an **SSL certificate**.  
🔹 **Step 4**: The website is now **HTTPS secured**.  
🔹 **Step 5**: Every **90 days**, the certificate **must be renewed** (can be automated).

✅ **Example**:  
A **news website** wants to enable HTTPS. They run a command using **Certbot** (a tool provided by Let’s Encrypt), and within minutes, their website is secured with HTTPS.

### **How Let’s Encrypt Verifies a Website?**

There are two ways Let’s Encrypt verifies ownership:  
1️⃣ **HTTP Challenge** – Creates a temporary file on the website’s server to prove ownership.  
2️⃣ **DNS Challenge** – Adds a special DNS record to the domain settings for verification.

✅ **Example**:

- A **tech blog** uses the **HTTP challenge** to get a certificate.
- A **banking app** uses the **DNS challenge** for extra security.

### **Why Businesses Use Let’s Encrypt?**

🔹 **Free** – No cost for SSL certificates.  
🔹 **Automatic** – Certificates can be **renewed automatically**.  
🔹 **Trusted** – Works on almost all browsers and devices.  
🔹 **Secure** – Uses strong **TLS encryption**.  
🔹 **Fast Setup** – Can be installed in **minutes**.

✅ **Example**:  
A **small online store** uses Let’s Encrypt instead of buying an expensive SSL certificate, saving money while still ensuring security.

---

### **Limitations of Let’s Encrypt**

🔹 **Only provides Domain Validation (DV) certificates** – No **organization validation (OV)** or **extended validation (EV)** certificates.  
🔹 **90-day expiry** – Must be renewed every **3 months** (can be automated).  
🔹 **No warranty** – Paid SSL providers like DigiCert offer financial protection, but Let’s Encrypt doesn’t.

✅ **Example**:  
A **large financial institution (like a bank)** won’t use Let’s Encrypt because they need an **EV certificate**, which shows company details in the browser bar.

### **Comparison: Let’s Encrypt vs Paid SSL**

|Feature|Let’s Encrypt (Free)|Paid SSL (DigiCert, GoDaddy)|
|---|---|---|
|**Cost**|Free|₹5,000 – ₹50,000 per year|
|**Validation**|Domain Validation (DV)|OV/EV for extra security|
|**Setup Time**|Fast (5 mins)|Takes longer|
|**Renewal**|Every 90 days|1-2 years|
|**Warranty**|No warranty|Offers financial warranty|

✅ **Example**:

- **A startup or personal blog** → **Uses Let’s Encrypt** for free HTTPS.
- **A bank or enterprise website** → **Buys an EV SSL certificate** for extra security.

### **How to Get a Free SSL Certificate from Let’s Encrypt?**

1️⃣ Install **Certbot** on your server.  
2️⃣ Run a simple command (`certbot --nginx` or `certbot --apache`).  
3️⃣ Let’s Encrypt verifies your domain.  
4️⃣ SSL certificate is installed, and your website becomes **HTTPS-secure**!  
5️⃣ Set up **automatic renewal** using a cron job (`certbot renew`).

✅ **Example**:
