#### **1. What is HTTPS?**

**HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** is the secure version of HTTP. It ensures that data sent between the userâ€™s browser and the website is **encrypted** and **protected** from hackers.

âœ… **Example**: Imagine you are entering your credit card details on an e-commerce website like **Amazon**. If the site uses **HTTP**, hackers can **steal your information**. But if it uses **HTTPS**, your data is **encrypted** and **safe**.

#### **2. What is SSL/TLS?**

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** are encryption protocols that make HTTPS secure.

- **SSL** was the older version.
- **TLS** is the modern and more secure version.
- **TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3** are the most used versions today.

âœ… **Example**: Think of SSL/TLS like a **sealed envelope**.  
When you send a letter:

- **Without SSL/TLS (HTTP)**: The letter is **open**, and anyone can read it.
- **With SSL/TLS (HTTPS)**: The letter is **sealed** in an envelope, so only the right person can read it.

#### **3. How HTTPS Works?**

ðŸ”¹ **Step 1**: The browser (Chrome, Firefox) sends a request to the website.  
ðŸ”¹ **Step 2**: The website sends an **SSL Certificate** to the browser.  
ðŸ”¹ **Step 3**: The browser verifies the certificate and starts **secure communication**.  
ðŸ”¹ **Step 4**: All data between the user and the website is **encrypted** using **TLS**.

âœ… **Example**: When you log in to **Gmail**, your **username & password** are **encrypted** before reaching Googleâ€™s servers.

#### **4. Why Do Companies Use HTTPS?**

ðŸ”¹ **Security** â€“ Protects users from hackers.  
ðŸ”¹ **Trust** â€“ Websites with HTTPS get a **padlock** icon ðŸ”’, showing they are safe.  
ðŸ”¹ **SEO** â€“ Google ranks **HTTPS websites higher** than HTTP.  
ðŸ”¹ **Compliance** â€“ Many industries require HTTPS for legal reasons (e.g., banking, healthcare).

âœ… **Example**:

- **Banks** (HDFC, SBI, PayPal) use HTTPS to **protect transactions**.
- **E-commerce** (Amazon, Flipkart) use HTTPS to **secure payments**.
- **Social Media** (Facebook, Instagram) use HTTPS to **protect user data**.

---

#### **5. How Can a Business Get HTTPS?**

A company needs an **SSL Certificate** from a **Certificate Authority (CA)** like:

- **Letâ€™s Encrypt** (Free SSL)
- **DigiCert, GlobalSign, GoDaddy** (Paid SSL)

âœ… **Example**: A startup launching a new website can use **Letâ€™s Encrypt** to get a free SSL certificate and enable HTTPS.

---

#### **Summary**

ðŸ”¹ **HTTPS = HTTP + SSL/TLS (Encryption for security).**  
ðŸ”¹ **TLS ensures data is encrypted & safe from hackers.**  
ðŸ”¹ **Industries like banking, e-commerce, and social media must use HTTPS.**

## **Note**
#### **Default Ports for Web Servers:**

- **Port 80** â†’ Used for **HTTP (Unsecured)** websites.
- **Port 443** â†’ Used for **HTTPS (Secured with SSL/TLS)** websites.

## **How It Works in a Browser?**

When you enter a URL like `http://example.com`, your browser **automatically** connects to **port 80**.  
When you enter `https://example.com`, your browser **automatically** connects to **port 443**.

You **donâ€™t need to type** the port number in the browser because these are **default ports**.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**

- `http://example.com` â†’ Connects to `example.com:80`
- `https://example.com` â†’ Connects to `example.com:443`

If you want to use a **custom port**, you must specify it:

- `https://example.com:8443` â†’ Connects to `example.com` on **port 8443** instead of 443.
