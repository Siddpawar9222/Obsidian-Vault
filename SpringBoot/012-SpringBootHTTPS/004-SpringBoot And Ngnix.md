Let's Encrypt and Nginx work together to provide **secure HTTPS connections** for websites and applications. Here’s how they are related:

1. **Let's Encrypt** is a **Certificate Authority (CA)** that provides **free SSL/TLS certificates** to encrypt website traffic and make it secure.
2. **Nginx** is a **web server** that handles HTTP requests and serves web pages or acts as a reverse proxy for backend applications.

### How They Work Together:

- **Let's Encrypt provides the SSL certificate** → This certificate is needed for HTTPS.
- **Nginx uses the SSL certificate** → It helps serve your website or backend API over a secure HTTPS connection.
- **Certbot (Let's Encrypt tool) helps manage certificates** → It automatically requests, installs, and renews the SSL certificate on the Nginx server.

### Simple Real-World Example:

Imagine you own a shop (your website), and you need a **security guard (SSL certificate)** to ensure safe transactions. **Let's Encrypt gives you a free security guard**, and **Nginx makes sure that the guard is standing at the entrance (configures HTTPS properly).**
