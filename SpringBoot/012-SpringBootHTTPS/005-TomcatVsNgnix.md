### **Difference Between Nginx and Tomcat **


| Feature              | **Nginx**                                                      | **Tomcat**                                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**             | Web Server & Reverse Proxy                                     | Application Server (Servlet Container)                         |
| **Purpose**          | Serves static content, acts as a load balancer & reverse proxy | Runs Java-based applications (JSP, Servlets, Spring Boot)      |
| **Language Support** | Works with PHP, Node.js, Python, Java, etc.                    | Designed for Java web applications                             |
| **Performance**      | Fast for handling multiple connections & static files          | Handles Java application execution but slower for static files |
| **Usage**            | Front-end proxy server, load balancer, API gateway             | Back-end Java application hosting                              |

### **Industrial Example: How They Work Together**

#### **Scenario: Banking Application**

A bank has a web application for customers to manage their accounts.

#### **Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend (API Layer)**: Spring Boot (Java, running on Tomcat)
- **Reverse Proxy & Load Balancer**: Nginx

#### **How Nginx & Tomcat Work Together:**

1. **User Requests Website**
    
    - A user enters **[www.mybank.com](http://www.mybank.com/)** in their browser.
    - The request first goes to **Nginx**.
2. **Nginx Handles Request**
    
    - If it's a static file (CSS, images, JS), **Nginx serves it directly** (fast response).
    - If it's a dynamic request (login, transactions), Nginx **forwards it to Tomcat**.
3. **Tomcat Processes Java Application**
    
    - Tomcat runs the **Spring Boot banking API**.
    - Fetches data (e.g., balance details) from the database.
    - Sends the response back to Nginx.
4. **Nginx Returns Response to User**
    
    - Nginx receives the response from Tomcat.
    - It forwards it to the browser efficiently.

#### **Why Use Both?**

- **Nginx is better for static files & load balancing.**
- **Tomcat is better for Java application execution.**
- **Nginx improves performance by reducing Tomcatâ€™s load.**
