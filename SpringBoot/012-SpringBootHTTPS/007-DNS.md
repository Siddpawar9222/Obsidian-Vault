### **What is DNS? (Domain Name System)**

DNS (Domain Name System) is like the **phonebook of the internet**. It **converts domain names (e.g., geekysiddhesh.tech)** into **IP addresses (e.g., 3.111.243.215)** so that computers can communicate with each other.

### **Why Do We Need DNS?**

Imagine you want to visit **Google**:

- You type `www.google.com` in your browser.
- But computers don‚Äôt understand names‚Äîthey use **IP addresses**.
- DNS translates `www.google.com` into its actual IP address (e.g., `142.250.182.206`).
- Your browser then connects to that IP, and Google loads.

**Without DNS**, we would have to remember numbers like `142.250.182.206` instead of just typing `google.com`.

### **How DNS Works?**

When you enter a website URL, DNS follows these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Browser Checks Cache**

- Your browser first checks if it already knows the IP from previous visits.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Contacts Recursive DNS Resolver**

- If not cached, your internet provider (ISP) sends the request to a **DNS resolver** (e.g., Google‚Äôs DNS `8.8.8.8`).

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Resolver Queries Root DNS Server**

- The resolver asks the **root DNS server** where to find `.tech` domains.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Finds the Authoritative DNS Server**

- The `.tech` TLD server directs the query to BigRock‚Äôs DNS (since you bought `geekysiddhesh.tech` there).

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Gets the Correct IP**

- BigRock‚Äôs DNS tells the resolver: ‚Äú`geekysiddhesh.tech` = `3.111.243.215`‚Äù.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Website Loads**

- Your browser connects to `3.111.243.215` (your AWS EC2 instance), and your website appears! üöÄ

### **DNS Record Types (Important for AWS Setup)**

When setting up your domain, you‚Äôll deal with different **DNS records**:

|**Record Type**|**Purpose**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**A Record**|Maps a domain to an IP address|`geekysiddhesh.tech ‚Üí 3.111.243.215`|
|**CNAME**|Alias for another domain|`www.geekysiddhesh.tech ‚Üí geekysiddhesh.tech`|
|**MX Record**|Handles email servers|`mail.geekysiddhesh.tech ‚Üí Gmail servers`|
|**TXT Record**|Stores text (for verification)|Used for SSL, SPF, DKIM|

---

### **Real-World Example (Your Case)**

Since you have **geekysiddhesh.tech** on **BigRock** and an **AWS EC2 server**, you should:

1. **Create an A Record** ‚Üí Point `geekysiddhesh.tech` to your **EC2 Public IP** (`3.111.243.215`).
2. **Create a CNAME Record** ‚Üí Point `www.geekysiddhesh.tech` to `geekysiddhesh.tech`.
3. **Wait for DNS Propagation** (takes 5 mins to 24 hours).

### **Conclusion**

- DNS **translates domain names** into IP addresses.
- It **makes the internet user-friendly** (we don‚Äôt have to remember numbers).
- You need to **configure DNS records properly** to connect your domain to AWS.
