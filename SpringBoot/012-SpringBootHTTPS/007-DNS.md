### **What is DNS? (Domain Name System)**

DNS (Domain Name System) is like the **phonebook of the internet**. It **converts domain names (e.g., geekysiddhesh.tech)** into **IP addresses (e.g., 3.111.243.215)** so that computers can communicate with each other.

---

### **Why Do We Need DNS?**

Imagine you want to visit **Google**:

- You type `www.google.com` in your browser.
- But computers don’t understand names—they use **IP addresses**.
- DNS translates `www.google.com` into its actual IP address (e.g., `142.250.182.206`).
- Your browser then connects to that IP, and Google loads.

**Without DNS**, we would have to remember numbers like `142.250.182.206` instead of just typing `google.com`.

---

### **How DNS Works?**

When you enter a website URL, DNS follows these steps:

1️⃣ **Browser Checks Cache**

- Your browser first checks if it already knows the IP from previous visits.

2️⃣ **Contacts Recursive DNS Resolver**

- If not cached, your internet provider (ISP) sends the request to a **DNS resolver** (e.g., Google’s DNS `8.8.8.8`).

3️⃣ **Resolver Queries Root DNS Server**

- The resolver asks the **root DNS server** where to find `.tech` domains.

4️⃣ **Finds the Authoritative DNS Server**

- The `.tech` TLD server directs the query to BigRock’s DNS (since you bought `geekysiddhesh.tech` there).

5️⃣ **Gets the Correct IP**

- BigRock’s DNS tells the resolver: “`geekysiddhesh.tech` = `3.111.243.215`”.

6️⃣ **Website Loads**

- Your browser connects to `3.111.243.215` (your AWS EC2 instance), and your website appears! 🚀

### **DNS Record Types (Important for AWS Setup)**

When setting up your domain, you’ll deal with different **DNS records**:

| **Record Type** | **Purpose**                    | **Example**                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **A Record**    | Maps a domain to an IP address | `geekysiddhesh.tech → 3.111.243.215`          |
| **CNAME**       | Alias for another domain       | `www.geekysiddhesh.tech → geekysiddhesh.tech` |
| **MX Record**   | Handles email servers          | `mail.geekysiddhesh.tech → Gmail servers`     |
| **TXT Record**  | Stores text (for verification) | Used for SSL, SPF, DKIM                       |

---

### **Real-World Example (Your Case)**

Since you have **geekysiddhesh.tech** on **BigRock** and an **AWS EC2 server**, you should:

1. **Create an A Record** → Point `geekysiddhesh.tech` to your **EC2 Public IP** (`3.111.243.215`).
2. **Create a CNAME Record** → Point `www.geekysiddhesh.tech` to `geekysiddhesh.tech`.
3. **Wait for DNS Propagation** (takes 5 mins to 24 hours).

---

### **Conclusion**

- DNS **translates domain names** into IP addresses.
- It **makes the internet user-friendly** (we don’t have to remember numbers).
- You need to **configure DNS records properly** to connect your domain to AWS.


----

### What is **CNAME**?

**CNAME** stands for **Canonical Name**.

It is a type of **DNS (Domain Name System)** record.

---

### 🧵 Real-World Example:

Imagine this:

- You have a friend named **Siddhesh**.
    
- But some people also call him **"GeekyDev"**.
    
- Now, instead of giving two addresses (one for Siddhesh and one for GeekyDev), you say:
    
    👉 “If you're looking for **GeekyDev**, just go to **Siddhesh**’s house.”
    

That’s what **CNAME** does in the internet world.

---

### 💻 Technical Meaning:

Let’s say:

- You own a domain: `www.geekysiddhesh.tech`
    
- But your website is hosted on GitHub Pages at: `yourusername.github.io`
    

You can use a **CNAME record** like this:

```
www.geekysiddhesh.tech → yourusername.github.io
```

Now, when someone visits `www.geekysiddhesh.tech`, DNS knows to go to `yourusername.github.io` and fetch the website.

---

###  Why Use CNAME?

- To **map a custom domain** to a service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Heroku.
    
- To **avoid duplication** and make domain management easy.
    
- So that if your hosting provider changes their IP, you don't have to update your DNS.
    

---

### ❗ Important Rules

- CNAME can only be used for **subdomains**, not the root domain.
    
    - ✅ `www.geekysiddhesh.tech → yourusername.github.io`
        
    - ❌ `geekysiddhesh.tech → yourusername.github.io` (for root, use A record or ALIAS)

## BigRock to Route 53

### 🟢 Step 1: You bought a domain from **BigRock**

Example domain: `geekysiddhesh.tech`

BigRock is your **domain registrar** – the company that gave you the domain name.

---

### 🟢 Step 2: You created a **hosted zone** in **AWS Route 53**

In Route 53:

- You created a **Hosted Zone** for `geekysiddhesh.tech`.
    
- Route 53 automatically created **two DNS records** for you:
    

#### 1. `NS` Record (Name Server)

- This contains **four AWS name servers** like:
    
    ```
    ns-123.awsdns-45.org
    ns-456.awsdns-78.com
    ns-789.awsdns-90.net
    ns-012.awsdns-12.co.uk
    ```
    
- These tell the internet **“Hey, the DNS of this domain is now managed by AWS Route 53”**
    

#### 2. `SOA` Record (Start of Authority)

- This is a technical record that tells **which DNS server is the primary one**, and some other info (like refresh rate).
    
- You don’t have to change or worry about SOA.
    

---

### 🟢 Step 3: You copied the `NS` values from Route 53 to BigRock’s Name Server settings

At this point:

- You **went to BigRock** dashboard
    
- Found the **Name Server settings**
    
- Replaced the default name servers with the 4 AWS name servers from the Route 53 `NS` record
    

### ✅ This step is very important because:

> Now the world knows: “DNS settings for `geekysiddhesh.tech` are managed by AWS Route 53.”

---

### 🟢 Step 4 (Optional/Next): Add DNS records in Route 53

Now you can:

- Create **A records** or **CNAME records** in Route 53
    
- For example, point `www.geekysiddhesh.tech` to your server IP or GitHub Pages using CNAME
    

---

### 🔁 Summary:

|Step|What You Did|
|---|---|
|1|Bought domain from BigRock|
|2|Created hosted zone in Route 53|
|3|Got NS records from AWS|
|4|Updated BigRock nameservers with AWS NS records|
|✅|Domain is now controlled by AWS Route 53|
