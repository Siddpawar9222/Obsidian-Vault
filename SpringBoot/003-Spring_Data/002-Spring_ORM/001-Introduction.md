**Spring ORM:**
Spring ORM stands for "Spring Object-Relational Mapping." It's a part of the Spring Framework that simplifies the interaction between a Java application and a relational database.

**JPA (Java Persistence API):**
JPA stands for Java Persistence API. It is a Java specification that defines a standard way to interact with relational databases in Java applications. JPA provides a set of interfaces and annotations that allow you to work with databases in an object-oriented manner, meaning you can use Java objects to represent and manipulate data in a database.

**Hibernate:**
Hibernate is an implementation of the JPA specification. It's one of the most popular and widely used JPA providers. Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that allows you to map your Java objects to database tables and vice versa.

**JPA vs JDBC:**
- JDBC provides low-level access to the database, allowing developers to write complex SQL queries to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data. On the other hand, JPA is built on top of JDBC and provides a higher-level abstraction, allowing developers to work with objects in a more object-oriented manner. It simplifies the process of persisting and retrieving objects from the database, automating many common tasks.
- JPA is more suited for large-scale, complex database applications, while JDBC is more appropriate for smaller, simpler applications.
