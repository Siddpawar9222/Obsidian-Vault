## 🧠 First, what is an **expression**?

An expression is a combination of:

- **Operands** (like numbers: `2`, `3`, `a`, `b`)
    
- **Operators** (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
    
- That together represent a value.
    

For example:

```
2 + 3 * 4
```

## 📝 1. Infix Notation (What we normally write)

This is the **most common** way we write expressions.

### 🧾 Format:

```
operand operator operand
```

### 🧠 Example:

```
2 + 3
a * b
(2 + 3) * 4
```

- Operators are written **between** operands.
    
- **We need brackets** to show what to do first.
    
- Computers find this harder to evaluate directly.

## 🔁 2. Prefix Notation (also called Polish Notation)

Here, the **operator comes before** the operands.

### 🧾 Format:

```
operator operand1 operand2
```

### 🧠 Example:

```
+ 2 3         → means 2 + 3
* + 2 3 4     → means (2 + 3) * 4
```

- No brackets are needed.
    
- Easy for **recursive evaluation** (used by compilers).
    
- Evaluated from **right to left**.

## ➡️ 3. Postfix Notation (also called Reverse Polish Notation)

Here, the **operator comes after** the operands.

### 🧾 Format:

```
operand1 operand2 operator
```

### 🧠 Example:

```
2 3 +         → means 2 + 3
2 3 + 4 *     → means (2 + 3) * 4
```

- No brackets needed.
    
- Very easy to evaluate using a **stack**.
    
- Evaluated from **left to right**.

## 📊 Summary Table:

|Notation|Example for (2 + 3) * 4|Order of Evaluation|
|---|---|---|
|Infix|(2 + 3) * 4|Use brackets / rules|
|Prefix|* + 2 3 4|Right to left|
|Postfix|2 3 + 4 *|Left to right|

---

## 🔧 Real-world use:

- **Infix**: What we humans naturally write.
    
- **Prefix**: Used in **compilers and programming languages** internally.
    
- **Postfix**: Used in **stack-based calculators** and expression evaluators.
    

---

## 👨‍💻 Example: Evaluate postfix expression

```
2 3 + 4 * → (2 + 3) * 4 = 5 * 4 = 20
```

You can evaluate this using a stack:

1. Push 2 → stack: [2]
    
2. Push 3 → stack: [2, 3]
    
3. See `+` → pop 3 and 2 → compute 5 → push 5 → stack: [5]
    
4. Push 4 → stack: [5, 4]
    
5. See `*` → pop 4 and 5 → compute 20 → push 20 → stack: [20]
    

Final result: **20**
