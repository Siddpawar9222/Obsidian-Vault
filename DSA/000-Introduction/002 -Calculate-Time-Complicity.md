# How to Calculate Time Complexity

There are **two common approaches**.

## Method 1: Observation

Use this when the number of iterations is **obvious**.

### Example

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

The loop executes exactly **n times**.

```
Total Operations = n
```

Therefore,

```
Time Complexity = O(n)
```

---

## Method 2: Mathematical Summation

Use this when the number of iterations **changes in every iteration** of another loop.

### Example

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {

        System.out.println(j);

    }

}
```

### Work done in each outer iteration

```
i = 1  → 1 operation

i = 2  → 2 operations

i = 3  → 3 operations

…

i = n  → n operations
```

Total work becomes

```
1 + 2 + 3 + … + n
```

Using the arithmetic series formula,

```
1 + 2 + … + n

=

n(n + 1) / 2
```

Ignoring constants and lower-order terms,

```
Time Complexity = O(n²)
```

---

# Important Difference: Multiplication vs Summation

Many beginners confuse these two ideas.

### Multiplication

Used when **every outer iteration performs the same amount of work.**

```
Outer Loop = n

Inner Loop = n

Total

=

n × n

=

n²
```

---

### Summation

Used when **the work changes for every outer iteration.**

```
1 + 2 + 3 + … + n
```

Although the final answer is also

```
O(n²)
```

the way we reached it is completely different.

---

## Remember this

```
n × n
```

and

```
1 + 2 + 3 + … + n
```

are **not the same calculation**, even though both simplify to

```
O(n²)
```

---

# Golden Formula

Whenever the work changes during execution,

```
Total Work

=

SUM of (work done in each outer loop iteration)
```

This rule is always true.

---

# Rule for Nested Loops

---

## Case 1: Inner Loop is Independent

If the inner loop always runs the same number of times regardless of the outer loop variable, simply multiply.

### Example

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {

        System.out.println(i + j);

    }

}
```

Outer loop

```
n
```

Inner loop

```
n
```

Total work

```
n × n
```

Therefore,

```
O(n²)
```

---

## Case 2: Inner Loop Depends on Outer Loop

Never multiply immediately.

Instead, write the summation first.

### Example

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {

        System.out.println(j);

    }

}
```

Iterations become

```
1

2

3

…

n
```

Total work

```
1 + 2 + 3 + … + n
```

Formula

```
n(n + 1) / 2
```

Therefore,

```
O(n²)
```

---

# Another Important Example (Harmonic Series)

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j += i) {

        System.out.println(j);

    }

}
```

### Outer iterations

```
i = 1  → n

i = 2  → n/2

i = 3  → n/3

i = 4  → n/4

…

i = n  → 1
```

Total work

```
n + n/2 + n/3 + … + 1
```

Factor out **n**

```
n × (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + …)
```

The expression inside brackets is the **Harmonic Series**

```
Θ(log n)
```

Therefore,

```
O(n log n)
```

---

# Another Example (Worst Case)

Sometimes an operation inside a loop may itself take up to **O(n)**.

Example:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

    search(arr, target);   // Worst case O(n)

}
```

If `search()` performs a linear search,

```
Outer loop

=

n
```

```
search()

=

O(n)
```

Total

```
n × n

=

O(n²)
```

> **Always use the worst-case complexity of the operation inside the loop unless the question specifies otherwise.<font color="#ffc000"> Even if one operation take worst complicity we need to consider it</font>**

# Multiplication vs Summation

## Multiply When

- Inner loop is independent of outer loop.
    
- Every outer iteration performs the same work.

Example

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {

    }

}
```

```
n × n

=

O(n²)
```


---

## Use Summation When

- Inner loop depends on outer loop.
    
- Work changes every iteration.

Example

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {

    }

}
```

```
1 + 2 + … + n
```
- Observation Rule Here : 
  In above example for i = 16 , j calculation is 16 which  is worst , hence we can directly consider  n × n = O(n²)

---


# Worst Case Time Complexity

Unless the question specifically asks for **Best Case** or **Average Case**, always calculate the **Worst Case Time Complexity**.

Example

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

    System.out.println(i);

}
```

Worst Case

```
O(n)
```

# Checklist for Solving Time Complexity

Whenever you see code, ask yourself:

- Is there recursion?
    
- How many loops are there?
    
- Is the inner loop independent of the outer loop?
    
- If dependent, write a summation instead of multiplying.
    
- Does any loop divide or multiply its variable by a constant? (Usually `O(log n)`)
    
- Does the code match a known mathematical series (Arithmetic, Geometric, Harmonic)?
    
- What is the worst-case complexity of any operation inside the loop?
    
- Ignore constants and lower-order terms.
    
- Write the final answer using **Big-O notation**.
