## 💡 Goal of Writing Test Cases

👉 Test cases are not just to check “does it work”.  
They are to check **“does it break anywhere?”** 😄

When you write your own test cases, think:

> “If I were the interviewer or test system, how would I break my code?”

That mindset automatically makes your logic stronger 💪

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Way to Think About Test Cases

Let’s take your problem — **Merge Sorted Array** — as an example.

We’ll think test cases in **4 levels**.

---

### 🧩 1. **Normal Case (Happy Path)**

This is the “normal” test given in examples.

✅ Example:

```java
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m=3
nums2 = [2,5,6], n=3
Output = [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

👉 Purpose: Verify main logic works as expected.

---

### ⚙️ 2. **Boundary / Edge Cases**

These are cases at the **limit of valid input**.

Think:

- What if one array is empty?
    
- What if both arrays are size 1?
    
- What if elements are equal?
    
- What if all elements go to one side?
    

✅ Example 1: One array empty

```java
nums1 = [1], m=1
nums2 = [], n=0
→ [1]
```

✅ Example 2: nums1 empty

```java
nums1 = [0], m=0
nums2 = [1], n=1
→ [1]
```

✅ Example 3: All equal elements

```java
nums1 = [2,2,2,0,0,0], m=3
nums2 = [2,2,2], n=3
→ [2,2,2,2,2,2]
```

✅ Example 4: nums2 smaller elements

```java
nums1 = [4,5,6,0,0,0], m=3
nums2 = [1,2,3], n=3
→ [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

✅ Example 5: nums1 smaller elements

```java
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m=3
nums2 = [4,5,6], n=3
→ [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

👉 Purpose: Make sure you handle all input edges properly.

---

### 🧪 3. **Special / Tricky Cases**

Now think — what could confuse your code logic?

- Duplicates
    
- Negative numbers
    
- Non-overlapping but close values
    
- Single element overlap
    

✅ Example:

```java
nums1 = [-3,-2,-1,0,0,0], m=3
nums2 = [-2,-1,0], n=3
→ [-3,-2,-2,-1,-1,0]
```

✅ Example:

```java
nums1 = [1,2,4,0,0,0], m=3
nums2 = [2,3,5], n=3
→ [1,2,2,3,4,5]
```

👉 Purpose: Catch logical bugs that simple examples don’t show.

---

### 🧮 4. **Performance / Large Input**

Sometimes hidden tests check performance.  
If your solution is O(n²), it may time out.

✅ Example:

```java
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, ..., 100000, 0, 0, ..., 0]
nums2 = [1, 2, 3, ..., 100000]
```

→ Should merge efficiently without time limit error.

👉 Purpose: Ensure your logic is **efficient**, not brute force.

---

## 🧠 Step 5: Formula to Remember (Simple Trick)

Whenever you solve a problem, think of **5 test case types**:

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|1️⃣ Normal|Common input|`[1,2,3], [2,5,6]`|
|2️⃣ Empty|One input empty|`[1], []`|
|3️⃣ Same Elements|Duplicates|`[2,2,2], [2,2]`|
|4️⃣ Reversed Order|All nums2 smaller/larger|`[4,5,6], [1,2,3]`|
|5️⃣ Extreme|Big size or negative numbers|`[-3,-1], [-2,-1]`|

You can use this formula for **any problem**, not just this one.

---

## 💬 Real-World Example (How Developers Think)

Imagine you’re merging two **sorted files** on a server.  
You’d test like this:

- ✅ Files with data
    
- ⚙️ One empty file
    
- 🧪 Files with duplicate records
    
- 💡 File with all newer timestamps in one file
    
- 🚀 Very large files (performance test)
    

Same idea — you’re predicting all possible real-world situations.

## 💬 Summary

|Step|What to Think|Why|
|---|---|---|
|1️⃣ Normal|Does my logic work basically?|Sanity check|
|2️⃣ Edge|What happens at boundaries?|Stability|
|3️⃣ Tricky|Can duplicates/negatives break it?|Robustness|
|4️⃣ Large|Is it efficient?|Performance|
|5️⃣ Pattern|Does it follow the expected pattern?|Logic clarity|
