## **Your Final DP Problem-Solving Framework**

### **Step 1 â€“ Start with Recursion**

- Write the solution **ignoring performance**.
    
- Clearly **define the function meaning** in words.  
    Example: `f(i, W)` = max value achievable starting from item `i` with capacity `W`.
    
- Define **base cases** (smallest inputs).
    
- Write the **recurrence** (choices).
    
- Run for small inputs to verify correctness.
    

---

### **Step 2 â€“ Memoization (Top-Down)**

- **Identify changing variables** (parameters in recursion).
    
- Create a **dp array** of that dimension.
    
    - If variable can go up to `N` â†’ array size `N+1`.
        
    - Initialize with a sentinel value (like `-1`) for "not computed".
        
- Before recursion call, check `if dp[...] != -1` â†’ return it.
    
- Store result in `dp` before returning.
    

ðŸ’¡ **Goal**: Remove repeated work by caching.

---

### **Step 3 â€“ Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**

1. **Define the meaning of dp cell** clearly (e.g., `dp[cap][idx]` = best value with capacity `cap` starting at index `idx`).
    
2. **Identify dependencies** from recurrence:
    
    - Which variableâ€™s future values are needed? (**non-dependent variable** â†’ outer loop)
        
    - Which variable changes inside? (**dependent variable** â†’ inner loop)
        
3. **Initialize base cases** in dp array (values for smallest subproblems).
    
4. **Loop in the order that respects dependencies**:
    
    - If `dp[a][b]` depends on `dp[a][b+1]` â†’ loop `b` backward.
        
    - If it depends on smaller values of the same variable â†’ loop forward.
        
5. **Convert recursion formula to dp cell update** (replace recursive calls with dp lookups).
    
6. Return the dp value for the **original problem state**.
    

---

### **Step 4 â€“ Debug**

- If results mismatch, **draw the dp table** for small input:
    
    - Fill manually and compare with code.
        
    - This is often the fastest way to fix index/order bugs.
        

---

### **Step 5 â€“ Space Optimization (Optional for Now) : Not For Beginners**

- If dp only depends on previous row/column â†’ reduce to 2 arrays.
    
- If dp only depends on smaller indices in the **same** array â†’ loop in reverse and use a single array.

# Example : Rod Cutting Problem : 

## Recap of Your 3 Versions

### **1. Pure Recursion**

```java
for (i=1 â†’ n)
    maxPrice = max(price[i-1] + solve(n-i))
```

- Correct base case: if rod length = 0 â†’ 0 price.
    
- Explores all cut options.
    
- But exponential time â†’ TLE for large `n`.
    

---

### **2. Memoization (Top-Down)**

```java
if (memo[n] != -1) return memo[n];
memo[n] = max over cuts
```

- You stored results for each `n` (rod length).
    
- Time: **O(nÂ²)** (n choices Ã— n lengths).
    
- Space: **O(n)** for memo + recursion stack.
    

---

### **3. Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**

```java
dp[len] = best price for rod of length `len`
```

- Outer loop: `len` (rod size).
    
- Inner loop: try each cut `i`.
    
- Transition:  
    `dp[len] = max(price[i-1] + dp[len - i])`
    
- Return `dp[n]`.
    

âœ… This is **optimal tabulation**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Time and Space Complexity

- **Time:** O(nÂ²)
    
    - Outer loop runs `n` times, inner loop runs up to `len`.
        
- **Space:** O(n) for the dp array.
    

---

## ðŸ’¡ Observations

1. This is essentially a **1D unbounded knapsack** problem:
    
    - You can reuse the same cut multiple times.
        
    - Thatâ€™s why recurrence uses `dp[len - i]`.
        
2. Your tabulation is already **final optimized** (no extra dimensions needed).
    
3. The **recursive â†’ memo â†’ tab** flow you followed here is _exactly the standard pattern_ for most DP problems.
    

---

âš¡ So yes â€” your `cutRod()` **tabulation solution is correct and optimized**.  
Only possible improvement would be to **also return the cuts** (the actual way to cut the rod, not just the max price) if the interviewer asks.
