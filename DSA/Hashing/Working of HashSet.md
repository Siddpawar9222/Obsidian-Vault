A `HashSet` is a **collection that does not allow duplicate elements**. It uses a `HashMap` internally to store its elements, leveraging hashing for efficient operations. Let's break it down step-by-step with a dry run example.

---

### **Key Points:**

1. **Underlying Structure**:
    
    - A `HashSet` internally uses a `HashMap` to store elements.
    - Each element you add to the `HashSet` is stored as a **key** in the `HashMap`, and the value is a dummy constant (usually `Boolean.TRUE`).
2. **Operations**:
    
    - **Add**: It uses the `hashCode()` of the element to determine the bucket index and checks for collisions.
    - **Duplicate Prevention**: Before adding, it checks if the element already exists (using `equals()`).
    - **Search/Remove**: Operates similarly to a `HashMap`—uses hashing for efficient lookups.
3. **Efficiency**:
    
    - Time complexity for adding, removing, and searching is approximately **O(1)** (in ideal conditions, with minimal collisions).

### How HashSet Handles Collisions

A `HashSet` uses a `HashMap` internally, so collision handling in a `HashSet` works just like it does in a `HashMap`. Collisions occur when two different elements produce the same hash code and, therefore, map to the same bucket index.

---

### **Collision Handling in HashMap (and by extension, HashSet)**

When two elements have the same hash code (or the same bucket index), the following steps are taken:

1. **Linked List**:
    
    - Initially, each bucket in the HashMap is a **linked list**.
    - If a collision occurs, the new element is added as a **node** in the linked list at the corresponding bucket.
2. **Equals Check**:
    
    - Before adding the new node, the `equals()` method is used to check if the element is already present in the linked list. If it is, the element is not added (no duplicates allowed in HashSet).
3. **Treeification (Red-Black Tree)**:
    
    - If the number of nodes in a bucket exceeds a threshold (default: 8), the linked list in that bucket is converted into a **red-black tree**.
    - This improves the search time from **O(n)** (for a linked list) to **O(log n)** (for a tree).

### **Dry Run Example with Collision**

Let’s add elements to a `HashSet` where two elements collide (same hash code).

#### **Initial State**:

Capacity = `16` (default), Load Factor = `0.75`.

---

#### Step 1: Add `10`

1. **Hashing**: hashCode(10)=10,Index= 10 \% 16 = 10
2. **Bucket Check**:
    - Bucket `10` is empty.
    - Add `10`.

**State**:

- Bucket `10`: `[10 -> TRUE]`.

---

#### Step 2: Add `26` (Collision)

1. **Hashing**:
    
    - Let’s assume the hash code of `26` is `10` (same as `10`): hashCode(26)=10,Index= 10 \% 16 = 10
2. **Bucket Check**:
    
    - Bucket `10` already has `10`.
    - A linked list is used in bucket `10`.
3. **Equals Check**:
    
    - `10.equals(26)` → `false`.
    - Add `26` to the linked list.

**State**:

- Bucket `10`: `[10 -> TRUE] -> [26 -> TRUE]`.

---

#### Step 3: Add `42` (Another Collision)

1. **Hashing**:
    
    hashCode(42)=10,Index= 10 \% 16 = 10
2. **Bucket Check**:
    
    - Bucket `10` already has `10` and `26`.
3. **Equals Check**:
    
    - `10.equals(42)` → `false`.
    - `26.equals(42)` → `false`.
    - Add `42` to the linked list.

**State**:

- Bucket `10`: `[10 -> TRUE] -> [26 -> TRUE] -> [42 -> TRUE]`.

---

#### Step 4: Treeification (If Needed)

- If more elements are added to bucket `10` and the linked list exceeds the threshold (e.g., 8 elements), the bucket is converted into a **red-black tree**.

---

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine a parking lot with limited spaces (buckets). Each car (element) has a parking token (hash code) that decides its parking space (bucket index).

- **No Collision**: A car parks directly in the designated space.
- **Collision**: Two cars have tokens pointing to the same space. They form a line (linked list).
- **Too Many Cars in One Space**: The line is replaced with a more organized system, like a tree (red-black tree), to quickly find a car.

---

### Key Takeaways

1. **Hashing**:
    - Determines the bucket index.
2. **Collision**:
    - Resolved by using a **linked list** or a **red-black tree** if the list grows too long.
3. **Duplicate Prevention**:
    - The `equals()` method ensures no duplicate elements are added.


Note : 
  - The `TRUE` value is an implementation detail of the underlying `HashMap` used by the `HashSet`.
 - When thinking about `HashSet`, focus only on the **keys** (the elements in the set) and ignore the dummy value.
