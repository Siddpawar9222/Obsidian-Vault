### **Bucket Sort ** 

**Bucket Sort** is a sorting algorithm that **distributes elements into multiple "buckets" and sorts them individually**. It works best when input data is **uniformly distributed** over a range.

---

## **🔹 How Bucket Sort Works?**

1. **Create `k` empty buckets** (usually `k = N`, the number of elements).
2. **Distribute elements into buckets** based on a function (e.g., `arr[i] / maxValue`).
3. **Sort each bucket** (using Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, etc.).
4. **Concatenate all sorted buckets** into the final sorted array.

---

## **🔹 Dry Run Example**

### **Given Input Array:**

```
arr = [0.78, 0.17, 0.39, 0.26, 0.72, 0.94, 0.21, 0.12, 0.23, 0.68]
```

✅ **Numbers are between `0` and `1` (uniform distribution).**

---

### **🔹 Step 1: Create Empty Buckets**

Since we have **10 elements**, we create **10 empty buckets (0 to 9)**.

```
Bucket 0: []
Bucket 1: []
Bucket 2: []
Bucket 3: []
Bucket 4: []
Bucket 5: []
Bucket 6: []
Bucket 7: []
Bucket 8: []
Bucket 9: []
```

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Distribute Elements into Buckets**

We use the formula:

Bucket Index=⌊Element×10⌋\text{Bucket Index} = \lfloor \text{Element} \times 10 \rfloor

| $Element$ | $Computation$                                   | $Bucket #$ |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| $0.78$    | $⌊0.78×10⌋=7\lfloor 0.78 \times 10 \rfloor = 7$ | $7$        |
| $0.17$    | $⌊0.17×10⌋=1\lfloor 0.17 \times 10 \rfloor = 1$ | $1$        |
| $0.39$    | $⌊0.39×10⌋=3\lfloor 0.39 \times 10 \rfloor = 3$ | $3$        |
| $0.26$    | $⌊0.26×10⌋=2\lfloor 0.26 \times 10 \rfloor = 2$ | $2$        |
| $0.72$    | $⌊0.72×10⌋=7\lfloor 0.72 \times 10 \rfloor = 7$ | $7$        |
| $0.94$    | $⌊0.94×10⌋=9\lfloor 0.94 \times 10 \rfloor = 9$ | $9$        |
| $0.21$    | $⌊0.21×10⌋=2\lfloor 0.21 \times 10 \rfloor = 2$ | $2$        |
| $0.12$    | $⌊0.12×10⌋=1\lfloor 0.12 \times 10 \rfloor = 1$ | $1$        |
| $0.23$    | $⌊0.23×10⌋=2\lfloor 0.23 \times 10 \rfloor = 2$ | $2$        |
| $0.68$    | $⌊0.68×10⌋=6\lfloor 0.68 \times 10 \rfloor = 6$ | $6$        |

📌 **Buckets after distribution:**

```
Bucket 0: []
Bucket 1: [0.17, 0.12]
Bucket 2: [0.26, 0.21, 0.23]
Bucket 3: [0.39]
Bucket 4: []
Bucket 5: []
Bucket 6: [0.68]
Bucket 7: [0.78, 0.72]
Bucket 8: []
Bucket 9: [0.94]
```

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Sort Each Bucket Individually**

We use **Insertion Sort** (or any efficient sorting algorithm) for each bucket.

```
Bucket 1: [0.12, 0.17]
Bucket 2: [0.21, 0.23, 0.26]
Bucket 3: [0.39]
Bucket 6: [0.68]
Bucket 7: [0.72, 0.78]
Bucket 9: [0.94]
```

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Concatenate Buckets**

We merge all sorted buckets to get the final sorted array.

```
Sorted Array: [0.12, 0.17, 0.21, 0.23, 0.26, 0.39, 0.68, 0.72, 0.78, 0.94]
```

🎉 **The array is now sorted!**

## **🔹 Time and Space Complexity**

- **Best Case:** O(N)O(N) → When elements are evenly distributed, and we use Insertion Sort inside small buckets.
- **Worst Case:** O(N2)O(N^2) → If all elements go into the same bucket (behaves like Insertion Sort).
- **Average Case:** O(N+K)O(N + K) → With `K` buckets and uniform distribution.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N+K)O(N + K) → Need extra space for buckets.

---

## **🔹 When to Use Bucket Sort?**

✅ Best when input is **uniformly distributed** (e.g., floating point numbers, percentages).  
✅ Works well when **bucket size is small** and **sorting inside buckets is fast**.  
❌ **Not good when elements are clustered in a few buckets** (behaves like O(N2)O(N^2)).  
❌ **Extra space required** for buckets.

---

## **🔹 Summary**

- **Distribute elements into buckets.**
- **Sort each bucket individually.**
- **Concatenate all sorted buckets to get the final sorted array.**

🚀 **Bucket Sort is powerful when data is uniformly spread over a range.**
